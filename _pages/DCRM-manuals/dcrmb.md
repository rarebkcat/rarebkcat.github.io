## PREFACE
### Background

<i>Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)</i>, referred to hereafter as DCRM(B), is
third in direct descent from <i>Bibliographic Description of Rare Books</i> (BDRB). BDRB
was published in 1981 as the interpretations of the Library of Congress for AACR2,
rules 2.12‐2.18, on early printed monographs. When it was due for revision, the
RBMS Bibliographic Standards Committee under Jackie M. Dooley teamed up with
Ben R. Tucker and Robert Ewald of the Library of Congress to produce Descriptive
Cataloging of Rare Books (DCRB), which appeared in 1991. In 1998, Robert L.
Maxwell, then chair of the Bibliographic Standards Committee, inaugurated the
current revision.

In contrast to the previous two editions of the rare book cataloging rules, the Library
of Congress preferred to be responsible for commenting on and approving the text
rather than actively engaged in writing it. Director for Cataloging Beacher Wiggins
(now Director for Acquisitions and Bibliographic Access) first authorized the
revision and the Bibliographic Standards Committee’s lead role in it, and Barbara B.
Tillett, Chief of the Cataloging Policy and Support Office, confirmed his decision.
Along with Elizabeth Robinson (team leader for rare book cataloging), Cataloging
Policy and Support Office members Margaret Detweiler and Robert Ewald (both
now retired) and Judith Kuhagen have scrutinized drafts and monitored DCRM(B)’s
progress.

DCRM(B) was already well underway when work on <i>RDA: Resource Description and
Access</i> (then called AACR3) was announced. The DCRM(B) editors briefly
considered, then rejected, postponing further work until after RDA’s publication.
We agreed it would be unwise to delay, given the progress already made on
DCRM(B) and the considerable investment to date of time, labor, and money.

### Changes from DCRB

The most significant changes from DCRB are: new introductory sections on "Objectives and Principles" and "Precataloging Decisions;" the explicit incorporation of machine‐made books into the rule text and examples; the addition
of Area 6; an expanded appendix on early letterforms and symbols (including images of early letters and symbols accompanied by their correct transcriptions); and new appendixes on collection‐level cataloging, core‐level cataloging, variations
requiring the creation of a new bibliographic record, and individual issues of serials. 


DCRM(B) gives expanded guidance and prescribes a more rigorous and consistent
approach to transcription than did DCRB, and incorporates a sharp distinction
between information transcribed from the source and information that has been
supplied by the cataloger. Transcribed information is never to be placed within
square brackets (unless the letter or character is unclear; see 0G6.2 XXLINKXX). Conversely, the
presence of square brackets in those areas of the description that require
transcription (see introductory section III.2.2 XXLINKXX) immediately and unambiguously
identifies text as supplied or interpolated. Another notable change related to more
rigorous transcription principles is that roman dates in the source are transcribed as
roman rather than arabic numerals.

Other changes include restricting transcription of the statement of responsibility to
the chief source of information; the inclusion of dust jackets as a prescribed source of
information for areas 2, 4, and 6 XXLINKXX; a discussion on the transcription of manufacturers
in Area 4 XXLINKXX; the exclusion of copyright dates from the date of publication element; the
elimination of special status for engraved title pages in the statement of extent; the
dropping of periods after cm and mm (approved for AACR2 in 2002 but
implementation deferred until publication in RDA), and an expanded section on
local notes. Area 0 XXLINKXX is substantially re‐organized, and the language throughout has
been made more consistent and explicit.

Our heartfelt thanks go, too, to the Folger Shakespeare Library for generously
providing meeting space for three DCRM(B) editorial meetings. All images come

Conscientious and insightful comment on earlier drafts of DCRM(B) was provided
by the Rare Books Department of Cambridge University Library; the Bibliographic
Standards Committee of the Rare Books and Special Collections Group, Chartered
Institute of Library and Information Professionals (UK); CC:DA; the Rare Book Team
of Yale University Library, and of course our partner in this endeavor, the
Cataloging Policy and Support Office of the Library of Congress.

We extend our warm gratitude to all those who, in addition to those listed above,
contributed to DCRM(B) by participating actively at the public hearing, commenting
on or proofreading drafts, and providing valuable research and expert opinion. This
is surely a community document: Karen Attar, Dorothy Auyong, Matthew Beacom,

The scores of students who have passed through my Rare Book School cataloging
course at the University of Virginia, and now, California, have helped shape this
document immeasurably, whether they know it or not. By applying their fresh and
inquisitive minds to DCRB and the drafts of DCRM(B), they have kept my own from
the dangers of a blindness born of too‐long acquaintance.

The index was prepared by Jean Skipp of IncludesIndex. The cover and title page
design is by Kathy Bowlin of Graphic Answers Inc.

Finally, I want to acknowledge and thank the four people who agreed to serve with
me as DCRM(B) editors, who have given generously of their time and considerable
intellect; it has been a delight as well as an education working with them: John Attig,
Robert L. Maxwell, Joe A. Springer, and Manon Théroux. Editors preparing the other
DCRM components have as well provided smart, substantive, cheerful, and most
welcome editorial help and advice: Randal S. Brandt, Ann W. Copeland, Jain
Fletcher, Jane Gillis, Juliet McLaren, and Stephen Skuce.

Manon Théroux deserves special recognition: as chair of the Editorial Team, she has
devoted uncountable hours (many of them while the rest of us slept, not to mention
postponing her honeymoon) to organizing the work of the editorial team, setting
meeting agendas, keeping track of its progress, taking up the slack when assigned
tasks fell through, carefully evaluating each proposed change and addition, writing
portions of new text, and making painstaking, well‐documented edits. My esteem,
gratitude, and admiration know no bounds.

### I. Scope and purpose

#### I.1. Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials

DCRM(B) is the first of several manuals providing specialized cataloging rules
for various formats of rare materials typically found in rare book, manuscript,
and special collection repositories.<sup>1</sup> Together, these manuals form Descriptive
Cataloging of Rare Materials (DCRM), an overarching concept rather than a
publication in its own right. DCRM component manuals for serials and music are
in preparation. Other components will be added to the DCRM family as they are
developed.

<sup>1</sup>The term "rare materials" is used to refer to any special materials that repositories have
chosen to distinguish from general materials by the ways in which they house, preserve, or
collect them. Rarity in the narrow sense of "scarce" may or may not be a feature of these
materials.

#### I.2. Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)

DCRM(B) provides guidelines and instructions for descriptive cataloging of rare
books, that is, printed textual monographs receiving special treatment within a
repository. Unlike its predecessors, which were intended to apply exclusively to
pre‐1801 imprints, DCRM(B) may be used for printed monographs of any age or
type of production. Rare maps, music, serials, and manuscripts of any type are
out of scope, with the exception of individual and special issues of serials treated
as monographs (see Appendix H XXLINKXX).

#### I.3 Need for special rules

Printed materials in special collections often present situations not ordinarily
encountered in the cataloging of typical modern publications (e.g., variation
between copies, cancelled leaves, etc.) and may require additional details of
description in order to identify significant characteristics (e.g., bibliographical
format, typeface, etc.). Such details are important for two reasons. They permit
the ready identification of copies of a resource (e.g., as editions, impressions, or
issues), and they provide a more exact description of the resource as an artifact.


#### I.4. Scope of application

DCRM(B) is especially appropriate for the description of publications produced
before the introduction of machine printing in the nineteenth century. However,
it may be used to describe any printed monograph, including machine‐press
publications, artists’ books, private press books, and other contemporary
materials.

These rules may be applied categorically to books based on date or place of
publication (e.g., all British and North American imprints published before 1831),
or may be applied selectively, according to the administrative policy of the
institution, which may choose to catalog some or all of its holdings at a more
detailed level of description than that provided for in AACR2. (See introductory
section X.1 XXLINKXX for discussion on choosing appropriate cataloging codes and levels.)

#### I.5. Application within the bibliographic record

These rules contain instructions for the descriptive elements in bibliographic
records only. They do not address the construction and assignment of controlled
headings used as main and added entries, although brief instructions relating to
headings and other access points do appear throughout (e.g., Appendix F XXLINKXX is
entirely devoted to recommendations for uncontrolled title added entries).

### II. Relationship to other standards

#### II.1. AACR2, ISBD(A), and other cataloging documentation

As a revision of DCRB, DCRM(B) is based on AACR2 as amended by the Library
of Congress Rule Interpretations (LCRI), as well as on the second edition of
ISBD(A). The Library of Congress authorizes DCRM(B) as its interpretation of
AACR2, 2.12‐18. DCRM(B) deviates in substance from AACR2 and LCRI only
when required by the particular descriptive needs of rare materials. In matters of
style, presentation, wording, and subarrangement within areas, DCRM(B)
follows its own conventions.

Refer to AACR2 and LCRI for guidance and instructions on matters of
description not covered in DCRM(B). The relevant sections of AACR2 and LCRI
must be consulted for rules governing name and uniform title headings to be
used as access points for authors, editors, illustrators, printers, series, etc. For
subject headings, numerous controlled vocabularies are available; within the
United States, the subject headings of the Library of Congress are widely used.
Consult classification documentation for assignment of call numbers. For
genre/form headings, consult the various specialized thesauri issued by the
RBMS Bibliographic Standards Committee. Terms from other authorized
thesauri (e.g., the Art & Architecture Thesaurus Online XXLINKXX) may also be used as
appropriate.

#### II.2. MARC 21

MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data XXLINKXX is the presumed format for presentation
and communication of machine‐readable cataloging. Use of DCRM(B), however,
need not be restricted to a machine environment, and MARC 21 is not
mandatory. Examples in the body of DCRM(B) are shown using ISBD
punctuation; use of MARC 21 coding appears only in some of the appendixes.
Catalogers using MARC 21 should follow MARC 21 documentation for input,
and be aware of how their bibliographic systems interpret MARC 21 codes to
automatically generate display features. This usually means, for example, that
the cataloger omits punctuation between areas, parentheses enclosing a series
statement, and certain words prefacing formal notes.

### III. Objectives and principles

The instructions contained in DCRM are formulated according to the objectives
and principles set forth below. These objectives and principles seek to articulate
the purpose and nature of specialized cataloging rules for rare materials. They
are informed by long‐accepted concepts in bibliographic scholarship and the
Anglo‐American cataloging tradition, as well as by more recent theoretical work
important to the construction and revision of cataloging codes, namely the
International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions’ <i>Functional
Requirements for Bibliographic Records</i> (FRBR) and Elaine Svenonius’s <i>The
Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization</i>. As such, the objectives and
principles are also in conformity with the IFLA <i>Statement of International
Cataloguing Principles</i> (2009). They assume familiarity with the FRBR terms
used to categorize entities that are the products of intellectual or artistic
endeavor (work, expression, manifestation, and item) as well as bibliographic
terms used to differentiate among textual variants (edition, issue, impression,
and state). It is hoped that these objectives and principles will provide catalogers,
and administrators of cataloging operations, with a better understanding of the
underlying rationale for DCRM instructions.

#### III.1. Functional objectives of DCRM

The primary objectives in cataloging rare materials are no different from those in
cataloging other materials. These objectives focus on meeting user needs to find,
identify, select, and obtain materials. However, users of rare materials often
bring specialized requirements to these tasks that cannot be met by general
cataloging rules, such as those contained in the latest revision of AACR2. In
addition, the standard production practices assumed in general cataloging rules
do not always apply to rare materials. The following DCRM objectives are
designed to accommodate these important differences.

##### III.1.1. Users must be able to distinguish clearly among different manifestations of an expression of a work

The ability to distinguish among different manifestations of an expression of a
work is critical to the user tasks of identifying and selecting bibliographic
resources. In general cataloging codes like AACR2, it is assumed that
abbreviated and normalized transcription is sufficient to distinguish among
manifestations. Users of rare materials, however, often require fuller, more
faithful transcriptions, greater detail in the physical description area, and careful
recording of various distinguishing points in the note area, in order to identify
separate manifestations. Additionally, users of rare materials are typically
interested in drawing finer distinctions among variants within manifestations
than are users of other materials, including not simply between editions and
issues but between variant impressions and states; many also need to distinguish
between copies at the item level.

##### III.1.2. Users must be able to perform most identification and selection tasks without direct access to the materials

Users of rare materials frequently perform identification and selection tasks
under circumstances that require the bibliographic description to stand as a
detailed surrogate for the item (e.g., consultation from a distance, limited access
due to the fragile condition of the item, inability to physically browse collections
housed in restricted areas, etc.). Accuracy of bibliographic representation
increases subsequent efficiency for both users and collection managers. The same
accuracy contributes to the long‐term preservation of the materials themselves,
by reducing unnecessary circulation and examination of materials that do not
precisely meet users’ requirements.

##### III.1.3. Users must be able to investigate physical processes and postproduction history and context exemplified in materials described

Users of rare materials routinely investigate a variety of artifactual and postproduction
aspects of materials. For example, they may want to locate materials
that are related by printing methods, illustration processes, binding styles and
structures, provenance, genre/form, etc. The ability of users to identify materials
that fit these criteria depends upon full and accurate descriptions and the
provision of appropriate access points.

##### III.1.4. Users must be able to gain access to materials whose production or presentation characteristics differ from modern conventions

In order to distinguish among manifestations, general cataloging codes like
AACR2 rely on explicit bibliographic evidence presented in conventional form
(e.g., a formal edition statement on the title page or its verso). In rare materials,
such explicit evidence will often be lacking or insufficient to distinguish among
different manifestations. That which is bibliographically significant may thus be
obscured.

#### III.2. Principles of DCRM construction

To meet the objectives listed above, DCRM relies upon the following six
principles. These principles are influenced by the general principles of
bibliographic description offered by Svenonius: user convenience;
representation; sufficiency and necessity; standardization; and integration.

##### III.2.1. Rules provide guidance for descriptions that allow users to distinguish clearly among different manifestations of an expression of a work

This principle derives from the general principle of user convenience and has
implications for all areas of the bibliographic description. The principle relates to
objective 1 XXLINKXX stated above.

##### III.2.2. Rules provide for accurate representations of the entity as it describes itself, notably through instructions regarding transcription, transposition, and omission

This principle derives from the general principles of representation (with its
related subprinciple of accuracy) and of standardization. Precise representation
is of particular relevance in those areas of the description that require
transcription (the title and statement of responsibility area, the edition area, the
publication, distribution, etc., area, and the series area), but should not be
ignored in the physical description and note areas. The general principles of
representation and standardization stand in greater tension with each other
when cataloging rare materials. Faithfulness to both principles may require
descriptive and annotative treatment necessarily exceeding the norms (and at
times the vocabulary) established as sufficient for the description of general
materials. The principle relates to objectives 2 XXLINKXX and 4 XXLINKXX stated above.

##### III.2.3. Rules provide guidance for the inclusion of manifestation‐specific and item‐specific information that permits users to investigate physical processes and post‐production history and context exemplified in the item described

This principle derives from the general principle of sufficiency and necessity
(with its related subprinciple of significance). Application of the principle
requires that rules for rare materials cataloging provide additional guidance on
access points, particularly in cases where such information is not integral to the
manifestation, expression, or work described. Rules for item‐specific information
appearing in the note area may recommend standard forms for presentation of
information (addressing the general principle of user convenience and its related
subprinciple of common usage). Application of such rules presumes both a user’s
need for such information and a cataloger’s ability to properly describe such
aspects. The principle relates to objective 3 XXLINKXX stated above.

##### III.2.4. Rules provide for the inclusion of all elements of bibliographical significance

General cataloging codes like AACR2 routinely strive for both brevity and
clarity, principles affiliated with the general principle of sufficiency. In
describing rare materials, too great an emphasis on brevity may become the
occasion for insufficiency and lack of clarity. Brevity of description may be
measured best against the functional requirements of the particular bibliographic
description rather than against the average physical length of other bibliographic
descriptions in the catalog. The tension between rules for rare materials that
promote accurate representation of an item and yet do not exceed the
requirements of sufficiency is great. Reference to the principle of user
convenience may offer correct resolution of such tensions. This principle is
related to all of the objectives stated above.

##### III.2.5. Rules conform to the substance and structure of the latest revision of AACR2 to the extent possible; ISBD(A) serves as a secondary reference point

This principle relates to general principles of standardization and user
convenience (with the latter’s subprinciple of common usage). DCRM assumes
that users of bibliographic descriptions constructed in accordance with its
provisions operate in contexts where AACR2 (often as interpreted and applied
by the Library of Congress) is the accepted standard for the cataloging of general
materials. Therefore, DCRM uses existing AACR2 vocabulary in a manner
consistent with AACR2; any additional specialized vocabulary necessary for
description and access of rare materials occurs in a clear and consistent manner
in DCRM rules, appendixes, and glossary entries. DCRM does not introduce
rules that are not required by differences expected between rare and general
materials. Numbering of areas within DCRM conforms to the structure of ISBD
as implemented in AACR2. When an existing AACR2 rule satisfies the
requirements of cataloging rare materials, DCRM text is modeled on AACR2 text
(substituting examples drawn from rare materials for illustration). In cases where
the language of AACR2 is not precise enough to convey necessary distinctions or
may introduce confusion when dealing with rare materials, DCRM uses carefully
considered alternative wording. Wording of relevant ISBD(A) standards was also
considered when deviating from AACR2.

##### III.2.6. Rules are compatible with DCRB except in cases where changes are necessary to align more closely to current revisions of AACR2 or to conform to the above principles

This principle relates to general principles of standardization and user
convenience (with the latter’s subprinciple of common usage). DCRM assumes
that users of bibliographic descriptions constructed in accordance with its
provisions operate in contexts where monographic materials in special
collections were cataloged, until recently, using DCRB. Therefore, changes to
DCRB cataloging practices were introduced only after careful consideration of
the value or necessity of such changes.

### IV. Options

Available options are indicated in one of three ways.

* ***Alternative rule*** designates an alternative option which affects all or several
areas of the description, and which must be used consistently throughout. In
DCRM(B), alternative rules apply to the transcription of original punctuation
and to the creation of separate records for individual impressions, states,
binding variants, or copies.
* *Optionally* introduces an alternative treatment of an element.
* ʺIf considered importantʺ indicates that more information may be added in a
note, and thus signals choices for more or less depth in the description. This
phrase covers the entire range between best practice on the one end, and
highly specialized practices on the other.

The cataloging agency may wish to establish policies and guidelines on the
application of options, leave the use of options to the discretion of the cataloger,
or use a combination of the two.

### V. Language preferences

DCRM(B) is written for an English‐speaking context. Cataloging agencies
preparing descriptions in the context of a different language should replace
instructions and guidelines prescribing or implying the use of English into their
preferred language (see 4B3‐4, 4B8‐12, 4E, and areas 5 and 7 XXLINKXX).

### VI. Spelling and style

DCRM(B) uses *Merriam‐Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary*, eleventh edition, as its
authority in matters of spelling, and in matters of style, the fifteenth edition of
the *Chicago Manual of Style*.

### VII. Acronyms

* AACR2 *Anglo‐American Cataloguing Rules*, second edition
* BDRB *Bibliographic Description of Rare Books*
* BIBCO Monographic Bibliographic Program of the PCC
* CC:DA Committee on Cataloging: Description and Access, Association for Library Collections and Technical Services, American Library Association
* DCRB *Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books*
* DCRM Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials
* DCRM(B) *Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)*
* ISBD *International Standard Bibliographic Description*
* ISBD(A) *International Standard Bibliographic Description for Older Monographic Publications (Antiquarian)*
* LC Library of Congress
* LCRI *Library of Congress Rule Interpretations* 
* PCC Program for Cooperative Cataloging
* RBMS Rare Books and Manuscripts Section, Association of College and Research Libraries, American Library Association
* RDA *Resource Description and Access*

### VIII. Examples and notes

#### VIII.1. Examples. 

The examples are not in themselves prescriptive, but are meant
to provide a model of reliable application and interpretation of the rule in
question. A word, phrase, element, or entire area may be illustrated; ISBD
punctuation is given as needed only for the portion illustrated.

#### VIII.2. Notes. 

The instructions and guidelines in area 7 XXLINKXX are written in imperative
form. This does not imply that all notes are required; on the contrary, most notes
are not (see 7A1.5 XXLINKXX). Consult the other areas of DCRM(B) in order to ascertain
what is required and what is optional in any given situation (see 7A1 XXLINKXX). The
conventions for notes included as part of the examples are as follows.

* "Note" indicates that the note is required if applicable.
* "Optional note" indicates that the note is not required. The labeling of a note
as "optional" in these rules carries no judgment about its importance (see
introductory section IV); certain notes designated as "optional" may in fact
be almost universally applied.
* "Local note" indicates a note describing copy‐specific information not
affecting areas 1‐6 that is required if applicable (see 7B19 XXLINKXX). It must be clearly
identified as a local note according to the provisions of 7B19.1.1 XXLINKXX. Copy specific
information that does affect areas 1‐6, such as basing the description
on an imperfect copy (see 0B2.2 XXLINKXX), is required and recorded in a general note.
* "Optional local note" indicates that the note describing copy‐specific
information is not required.
* "Comment" prefaces details needed to adequately explain the example, and
are not to be confused with notes appearing within the bibliographical
description.

### IX. Integrity of the copy

#### IX.1. Defects and sophistication

A greater vulnerability to damage, defect, and loss means that rare materials,
especially older printed materials, are less likely than modern materials to be in a
perfect or complete state when they reach the cataloger. One of the cataloger’s
tasks is to ascertain (within reasonable constraints) whether and how much the
copy in hand deviates from its original state as issued. Imperfections and defects
are usually easy to spot. Harder to spot during casual examination are
replacement leaves, plates, or sections from another copy, and the cataloger is
not expected to verify the integrity of each leaf in a publication unless there is
reason to suspect that the copy in hand may have been made up, doctored, or
falsified ("sophisticated"). Bibliographers’ and booksellers’ descriptions are the
usual source of such information.

#### IX.2. Dust jackets

In the context of rare materials cataloging, dust jackets issued by the publisher
are appropriately considered part of a publication, and are included in these
rules as prescribed sources for areas 2, 4, and 6. Dust jackets often contain
valuable information not found in any other source in the publication. Their easy
detachability, however, coupled with their original function as protection for the
binding only until it was safely in the hands of a reader, pose considerable
difficulties for the rare materials cataloger. A fine dust jacket from a poor copy
may have been exchanged with a poor dust jacket from a fine copy; the dust
jacket of an original printing may end up on the copy of a later manifestation,
and so on. When considering whether to transcribe information that appears
only on a dust jacket, consider that the dust jacket was issued with the
publication, unless there is reason to suspect otherwise.

### X. Precataloging decisions

Before a bibliographic record can be created for a monograph or group of
monographs awaiting cataloging in an institution’s special collections,
appropriate decisions must be made regarding the array of descriptive options
available to the cataloger. These precataloging decisions include: determining
whether DCRM(B) or AACR2 rules will govern the description, choosing the
level of cataloging that will be applied, and determining the extent to which
various options in the rules will be exercised.

Because DCRM(B) was written to address the special needs of users of rare
materials, it is likely to be the appropriate cataloging code for the majority of
printed monographs held in special collections. However, for some categories of
materials, the cataloging objectives (see introductory section III XXLINKXX) may be met by
use of AACR2 or by the application of options within the DCRM(B) rules that
permit less detail in the description. Full‐level DCRM(B) records that employ all
possible descriptive options will not necessarily be the best choice for every item.
The following section provides guidance for catalogers and cataloging
administrators faced with these decisions and identifies some of the institutional
and contextual factors that should be taken into consideration. It assumes that
certain routine choices will already have been made, such as whether the
encoding standard for the description will be MARC 21 and whether a resource
issued as part of a monographic series or multipart monograph will be analyzed.

Institutions may promote efficiency by setting cataloging policies for specific
categories of materials in their collections rather than making decisions on an
item‐by‐item basis. For example, an institution may decide to catalog all pre‐1831
books using DCRM(B), trace printers and booksellers for all pre‐18th‐century
books, but give signature statements and expansive descriptive notes for 15th and
16th‐century books only. It may choose to catalog all later books according
to AACR2, but add selected genre/form or provenance name headings. It may
decide that collection‐level cataloging is sufficient for brochures. A mechanism
for easily making exceptions to general cataloging policy is desirable as well. If,
for example, a curator buys a book for its notable cloth binding, description of
and access to the binding ought to be given in the bibliographic record, even if it
is not the institution’s usual policy to describe bindings.

### X.1. Decisions to make before beginning the description 

#### X.1.1. Item‐level vs. collection‐level description

Determine whether the material will receive item‐level description, collection-level
description, or some combination of the two.

Item‐level cataloging represents the normative application of the DCRM(B) rules.
Guidelines for creating collection‐level descriptions are found in Appendix B XXLINKXX.

Collection‐level cataloging is usually faster than item‐level&mdash;sometimes
dramatically so&mdash;but is attended by such a substantial loss of specificity that its
use as the sole final cataloging for a group of items should be chosen only after
careful consideration. The lack of specificity can be mitigated through provision
of some sort of item‐level control, such as an inventory list, finding aid, or
database, and such an approach is highly recommended. Collection‐level
cataloging of rare materials is most suitable when items have minimal value in
themselves but derive value as part of a collection. Use of collection‐level control
by itself may be appropriate when users are unlikely to be seeking known items,
or the risk of inadvertent purchase of duplicate individual items is considered
insignificant. Collection‐level control alone is unlikely to provide adequate
evidence to identify materials following a theft.

A combination approach would entail individual cataloging of all or selected
items in the collection in addition to the creation of a collection‐level record. Such
an approach may involve phased processing, whereby the cataloger creates a
collection‐level record to provide immediate basic access to the collection, and
then later creates item‐level records for priority items as time and resources
permit.

### X.1.2. Cataloging code: AACR2 vs. DCRM(B)

Determine which cataloging code will govern the description. Both codes contain
optional rules in addition to the required ones, and each allows varying levels of
cataloging depth.

In item‐level bibliographic records, use of AACR2 results in a description that
highlights the basic features of a publication and obscures some of the
differences between manifestations or between variants of a single manifestation.
AACR2 is generally considered to be easier and quicker to apply than DCRM(B).
AACR2 is most suitable when, in an institutional context, an item was acquired
and is of significance primarily for its content rather than its artifactual value. In
contrast, use of DCRM(B) produces more faithful transcriptions and more
accurate physical descriptions. It will be more likely to facilitate differentiation
between manifestations and reveal the presence of bibliographic variants among
seemingly identical items. DCRM(B) is most suitable when an item carries
artifactual or bibliographical significance, or it is otherwise important to provide
distinctions between issues, bibliographical variants, or individual copies.

### X.1.3. Encoding level: DCRM(B) minimal vs. core vs. full

Determine whether the description will be done at a minimal, core, or full level.

Each level has its particular uses with attendant advantages and disadvantages.
DCRM(B) minimal level provides for faithful transcription and exact physical
description, but requires neither notes nor headings. Minimal‐level records can
be produced quite quickly. Because name and subject headings may be lacking,
the materials represented by these records may be inaccessible through all but
known‐item searches, and so should be used only after careful consideration.
DCRM(B) minimal level may be suitable when accurate physical description is
desired but a record with few or no access points is acceptable, or when
particular language expertise among current cataloging staff is insufficient for
proper subject analysis. For further information on creating DCRM(B) minimallevel
descriptions, see Appendix D XXLINKXX.

**DCRM(B) core level** provides for faithful transcription and exact physical
description, a full complement of name headings, and at least one subject
heading, but requires few notes.<sup>2</sup> Core‐level records may be suitable for items or
collections that carry enough bibliographical or artifactual significance to benefit
from detailed description and controlled heading access, but for which the
omission of most notes is acceptable. For further information on creating
DCRM(B) core‐level descriptions, see Appendix C XXLINKXX.

<small><sup>2</sup> If an institution is a BIBCO participant contributing core‐level records as part of the Program
for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC), all headings must be established in the LC/NACO and
LC/SACO Authority Files.</small>

**DCRM(B) full level** represents the normative application of these rules, yet
encompasses a range of potential levels of detail. Full‐level records provide for
faithful transcription and detailed, complete physical description. Although
some notes are required (e.g., the source of the title proper if not the title page),
most are optional and can be applied selectively depending on the nature of a
collection or an institution’s needs. For example, signature statements,
descriptions of illustrative elements, names of illustrators and others responsible
for such elements, and particular attributes of the item in hand may be included
or omitted as desired.

Although treatment of headings is outside the scope of DCRM(B), full‐level records
typically contain a full complement of name and subject headings. In addition to
those typically given to general materials, DCRM(B) full‐level records may contain
headings for printers, publishers, illustrators, engravers, former owners, binders, etc.
The name headings need not be established using authority records, although full
authority work, especially if contributed to the LC/NACO Authority File, will result
in greater consistency of headings and improved access.<sup>3</sup>

<small><sup>3</sup> If an institution is a BIBCO participant contributing full‐level records as part of the Program
for Cooperative Cataloging (PCC), all headings must be established in the LC/NACO and
LC/SACO Authority Files.</small>

The addition of genre/form headings is particularly encouraged in full‐level records.
These may be used to provide access by literary genre (e.g., Herbals, Booksellers’
catalogs) or by physical form (e.g., Imposition errors, Annotations). Prefer the
terminology used in controlled vocabularies issued by the RBMS Bibliographic
Standards Committee. Terms from other authorized vocabularies (e.g., the Art &
Architecture Thesaurus XXLINKXX) may also be used as appropriate.

### X.1.4. Bibliographic variants

If two or more items can be identified as bibliographic variants of an edition,
decide whether to describe them using a single bibliographic record or multiple
records.

It is taken as a default approach in DCRM(B) that a separate record will be made
for each variant that represents what is referred to as an "edition" in AACR2 and
an "issue" in bibliographic scholarship. However, this default approach is not
prescriptive and indeed may not be desirable in every situation. Within the rules,
alternatives are provided (see 2B3.2, 2B4.2, 2D2, 4G xxlinkxx) that permit the creation of
separate records for individual impressions, states, binding variants, or copies.
Once the decision has been made to apply these alternative rules, the cataloger
must be consistent in applying them to all areas of the description. For further
guidance on the cataloging of bibliographic variants, see Appendix E xxlinkxx.

### X.2. Factors to consider in making these decisions

Consider the following factors when determining appropriate levels of
description and access for materials awaiting cataloging. These factors will help
to identify items that might deserve more detailed descriptions or higher priority
treatment.

#### X.2.1. Institution’s mission and user needs

Evaluate the relevance of the items awaiting cataloging to the institution’s
mission and the needs of its users. Ideally, the institution will have developed
internal documentation that will facilitate such an evaluation, including a
mission statement, collection development guidelines, and a listing of constituent
users and their anticipated needs. The needs of both patrons (researchers,
teachers, students, etc.) and staff (collection development, reference, technical
services, etc.) should be taken into consideration.

#### X.2.2. Institutional and departmental resources

Evaluate institutional and departmental resources, especially staffing levels,
expertise, and current workloads.
* Is staff able to keep up with the inflow of new materials?
* Is there a reasonable balance between resources devoted to acquiring materials and those devoted to processing them?
* Is current staff expertise in languages, subject areas, descriptive standards, and encoding standards adequate for implementing and/or completing proposed work plans?
* Is staff able to work concurrently with more than one code and/or description level?
* Are funding and space available for hiring new temporary or permanent staff with the necessary qualifications?
* Are adequate reference sources, such as specialized bibliographies, available for staff use?
* How many other projects are in process and what are their requirements and priorities?

The regular review of cataloging priorities is highly recommended and should
include discussions with curatorial, public services, technical services, and
preservation staff.

#### X.2.3. Market value and conditions of acquisition of the item or collection

Consider the conditions of acquisition and the estimated market worth of the
item or collection awaiting cataloging.
* Does the monetary or public relations value of the material justify a higher level of access than would otherwise apply?
* Have any access requirements been imposed by a donor as part of the terms of acquisition?
* Is the item or collection accompanied by bibliographic descriptions that will facilitate cataloging?

### X.2.4. Intellectual and physical characteristics of the item or collection

Finally, evaluate the intellectual and physical characteristics of the items
awaiting cataloging.
* Is there a unifying characteristic that would justify and facilitate the description of the materials as a collection (e.g., author, publisher, place of publication, genre/form, etc.)?
* Is a particular collection renowned?
* Do the materials have a topical focus that has recently acquired importance or urgency (e.g., due to a scholarly conference hosted by the institution or the hiring of a new professor with a particular specialty)?
* Is cataloging copy generally available?
* Were the items purchased primarily for their content?
* Do the specific copies have bibliographic or artifactual value?
* Is the institution collecting deeply in the area?
* Are detailed descriptions likely to reveal bibliographic variants that will be of interest to researchers?
* Are detailed descriptions likely to help prevent the inadvertent purchase of duplicates or the failure to acquire desirable variants?
* Is the item or collection vulnerable to theft or vandalism?
* Would a more detailed description help prevent unnecessary handling by staff and researchers?

0D. Prescribed sources of information  
0E. Prescribed punctuation  
0F. Language and script of the description  
0G. Transcription  

### 0A. Scope

These rules provide instructions for cataloging printed monographs—books,
pamphlets, and single‐sheet publications, other than maps and music—whose
rarity, value, or interest make special description necessary or desirable. They
cover instructions for the descriptive areas in bibliographic records only (see also
introductory sections I‐II XXLINKXX). Individual and special issues of serials and
unnumbered "special issues" may also be described as monographs (see
Appendix H xxlinkxx ).

### 0B. The basic description

#### 0B1. Required elements

The description must always include the following elements, regardless of the
completeness of the information available:
* title proper
* date of publication, distribution, etc.
* extent
* size

Also include other elements of description as set out in the following rules, if
available and appropriate to the chosen level of description.

### 0B2. Basis of the description

<a name="0B2.1">0B2.1</a> **General rule**. Base the description on the copy in hand.

<a name="0B2.2">0B2.2</a> **Imperfect copies**. If describing a copy known to be imperfect, and details
of a perfect (or more perfect) copy can be determined, base the description on the
perfect copy. Use square brackets only where required for description of the
perfect copy. In such cases, the details may be determined by examining
additional copies or by referring to reliable descriptions in other sources. As
appropriate, cite the source used for the description in a note (see 7B3, 7B14 xxlinkxx).
Make a local note describing the imperfection of the copy in hand (see 7B19.1 xxlinkxx).
If no reliable evidence of the details of a perfect copy is available, describe the
copy as it is. Make a general note indicating that the description is based on an
imperfect copy.

### 0C. Chief source of information

#### 0C1. Single title page

<a name="0C1.1">0C1.1</a> The chief source of information for a publication other than a single sheet
(see 1G xxlinkxx) is the title page, or, if there is no title page, the source from within the
publication that is used as a substitute for it. If information traditionally given on
the title page is given on two facing pages or on pages on successive leaves, with
or without repetition, treat all of these pages as the chief source of information.

<a name="0C1.2">0C1.2</a>. However, if the publication bears a cover issued by the publisher, and the
cover contains all the elements typically given on a title page but with more
recent information than that provided on the title page (e.g., a later edition
statement and publication date), choose the cover as the chief source of
information. Make a note to indicate that the cover has been chosen as the chief
source of information (see 7B3.1 xxlinkxx).

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Poetry of animated nature illustrated : a chaste, interesting and instructive present for juveniles. -- Second edition. -- Philadelphia : Published by Robert A. Smith, 1848</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Title, edition statement, and imprint taken from printed wrapper. Title page reads: Poetry of animated nature illustrated. In a series of numbers. Philadelphia: Published by Robert A. Smith, 1846</cite>

#### 0C2. Multiple title pages

If the publication has more than one title page, choose as the chief source of
information one of the following, applying the first applicable criterion:

a) If the title pages present the publication in different aspects (e.g., as an individual publication and as part of a multipart monograph), prefer the one that corresponds to the aspect in which the publication is to be treated.

b) If the publication is in more than one volume, each of which has a title page, use the title page in the first volume (or the lowest numbered volume if the first volume is not available).

c) If the publication is in one volume and the chief difference between multiple title pages is imprint date, choose the one with the latest date.

d) If the publication is in one volume and the chief difference between two title pages is that one is letterpress and the other is not, choose the letterpress title page.

e) If the publication has the same title page in more than one language or script, choose the title page that is in the language or script of the main part of the publication.

f) If two title pages face one another, choose the one on the recto of its leaf.

g) If two or more title pages follow one another, choose the first one.

Make a note indicating the source chosen as the chief source of information if
other than the usual title page, or, in a multipart monograph, if other than the
title page of the first volume (see 7B3 xxlinkxx).

#### 0C3. No title page

For publications issued without a title page (and for publications issued with a
title page when the title page is missing and no reliable description of it is
available), if a single title proper is available in a single source within the
publication, use this source as the title page substitute. If the same title proper is
available in more than one source within the publication, choose as the title page
substitute the source that supplies the most additional information. If different
titles, or differing forms of the same title, appear within the publication, choose
as the title page substitute one of the following, in this order of preference:

a) a source within the preliminaries or the colophon

b) a source elsewhere within the publication

c) a reference source

Make a note indicating the source chosen as the title page substitute (see 7B3 xxlinkxx).

Hereafter in these rules, "title page" means "title page or title page substitute."

#### 0D. Prescribed sources of information

The prescribed source(s) of information for each area of the description is set out
in preferred order below.

<table>
<caption>Prescribed sources of information</caption>

</table>

<small><sup>4</sup> Consider the cover to be a prescribed source only if it was issued by the publisher. Series-like
statements present on covers not issued by the publisher usually represent binders’ titles and should be treated as copy‐specific information. They may be transcribed in a local note, if considered important. In case of doubt, do not consider the cover to be a prescribed source of information.</small>

Do not transcribe information from the source in areas 1, 2, 4, and 6 unless it is
present in a prescribed source for that area. In all cases in which information for
areas 1, 2, and 4 is taken from elsewhere than the title page, make a note to
indicate the source of the information (see 7B3, 7B6, 7B7.1, 7B8 xxlinkxx ). In all cases in
which information for area 6 is taken from elsewhere than the series title page,
make a note to indicate the source of the information (see 7B12 xxlinkxx).

The prescribed source of information for areas 1‐6 of a single‐sheet publication is
the entire sheet, both recto and verso.

### 0E. Prescribed punctuation

Precede each area, other than the first, by a period‐space‐dash‐space (. ‐‐ ) unless
the area begins a new paragraph.

Precede or enclose each occurrence of an element of an area with standard
punctuation as indicated in the "prescribed punctuation" sections of these rules.
Precede each mark of prescribed punctuation by a space and follow it by a space,
with the following exceptions: the comma, period, closing parenthesis, and
closing square bracket are not preceded by a space; the opening parenthesis and
opening square bracket are not followed by a space.

End paragraphs with normal punctuation (usually the period).

If an entire area or element is omitted from the bibliographic description (e.g.,
because it is not present in the source), also omit its corresponding prescribed
punctuation. Do not use the mark of omission.

### 0F. Language and script of the description

#### 0F1. General rule

<a name="0F1.1">0F1.1</a> In the following areas, transcribe information from the publication itself in
the language and script (wherever feasible) in which it appears there:
* title and statement of responsibility<sup>5</sup>
* edition
* publication, distribution, etc.
* series

<small><sup>5</sup>If nonroman text has been transcribed within the first five words of the title proper, provide
additional title access for a romanized form of the title proper (see Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

<a name="0F1.2">0F1.2</a> Give interpolations into these areas in the language and script of the other
information in the area, except for prescribed interpolations and other cases
specified in these rules (e.g., 1E5, 4B5, 4B6.2, 4C6.2 xxlinkxx). If the other information in
the area is romanized, give interpolations according to the same romanization.

<a name="0F1.3">0F1.3</a> Give any other information (other than titles, citations, signatures, and
quotations in notes) in the language and script of the cataloging agency.

### 0F2. Romanization

<a name="0F2.1">0F2.1</a> If it is not feasible to transcribe from the publication using a nonroman
script, romanize the text according to the ALA‐LC Romanization Tables xxlinkxx. Do not
enclose the romanized text within square brackets. Make a note to indicate that
the romanized text appears in nonroman script in the publication (see 7B2.2 xxlinkxx).

>*Source*: ΔΙΟΝΥΣΙΟΥ ΟΙΚΟΥΜΕΝΗΣ περιήγησις  
>*Transcription*: <cite>Dionysiou oikoumenēs periēgēsis</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Title in Greek script</cite>

>*Transcription*: <cite>Hendecasyllabōn</cite>  
>Note: <cite>In the title, the ō in Hendecasyllabōn is printed in Greek script</cite>

<a name="0F2.2">0F2.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is feasible to transcribe from the publication using a
nonroman script, also provide parallel romanized fields using the ALA‐LC
Romanization Tables xxlinkxx. Do not enclose the romanized text within square brackets,
but make a note indicating that the romanization does not appear in the source.

> *Note*: Romanization supplied by cataloger

### 0G. Transcription

Transcribe information in the form and order in which it is presented in the
source, according to these general rules 0B‐0G, unless instructed otherwise by
specific rules. Do not use the mark of omission to indicate transposition.

#### 0G1. Letters, diacritics, and symbols

<a name="0G1.1">0G1.1</a> **Letters and diacritics**. In general, transcribe letters as they appear. Do not
add accents and other diacritical marks not present in the source. Convert earlier
forms of letters and diacritical marks to their modern form (see Appendix G2 xxlinkxx). If
the source uses a gothic typeface that does not distinguish between uppercase I
and J or between uppercase U and V, and there is no need to convert the letters
to lowercase (see 0G2.2 xxlinkxx), transcribe them as I and V respectively, even though
the actual letterforms will more closely resemble a modern J and a modern U
(see Appendix G4.1 xxlinkxx).

>*Source*: &lt;IMAGE NOT AVAILABLE&gt;  
>*Transcription*: <cite>Vnspotted Iacob</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: Source uses a gothic typeface that does not distinguish between the letterforms I/J or the letterforms U/V)

In most languages, including Latin, transcribe a ligature by giving its component
letters separately. Do not, however, separate the component letters of æ in
Anglo‐Saxon; oe in French; or æ and oe in ancient or modern Scandinavian
languages. If there is any doubt as to the correct conversion of letters and
diacritical marks to modern form, transcribe them from the source as exactly as
possible.

<a name="0G1.2">0G1.2</a> **Symbols, etc.** Replace symbols or other matter that cannot be reproduced
using available typographical facilities with a cataloger’s description in square
brackets. Make an explanatory note if necessary.

#### 0G2. Capitalization and conversion of case

<a name="0G2.1">0G2.1</a> **General rule**. Convert letters to uppercase or lowercase according to the
rules for capitalization in AACR2, Appendix A. Do not convert case when
transcribing roman numerals.

<a name="0G2.2">0G2.2</a> **Letterforms I,V, i, j, u, and v**. If the rules for capitalization require
converting **I** or **V** to lowercase, or **i**, **j**, **u**, or **v** to uppercase, follow the pattern of
usage in the text to determine which letterform to use in the transcription.<sup>6</sup>

<small><sup>6</sup> For information on early printing as it pertains to the transcription of **I**, **J**, **U**, **V**, **i**, **j**, **u**, and **v**,
and guidance on how to determine the pattern of usage, see Appendix G4 xxlinkxx. If any letterform
within the first five words of the title has been converted from **I** to **j**, from **j** to **I**, from **V** to **u**, or
from **u** to **V**, provide additional title access using alternative forms of the title proper as needed
(see Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

>*Source*: LES OEVVRES MORALES DE PLVTARQVE, TRANSLATEES DE GREC EN FRANÇOIS, REVEVES ET corrigees en plusieurs passages par le translateur  
>*Transcription*: <cite>Les oeuures morales de Plutarque / translatees de grec en françois, reueues et corrigees en plusieurs passages par le translateur</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: In the publication, the body of the text in roman type shows consistent use of v for vowels or consonants in initial position and u for vowels or consonants elsewhere, e.g., "ville," "vn," "conuersation," "tout," and "entendu")

0G2.3. Final capital ʺIʺ in Latin. Do not convert to lowercase a final capital I in Latin texts when the final I is uppercase and the immediately preceding letters in the word are lowercase or smaller capital letters. Since this usage is not merely typographic but affects meaning, the capital must be left in that form.<sup>7</sup>

<small><sup>7</sup> If the letter occurs within the first five words of the title proper, provide additional title
access for the form of title with the final capital I converted to ii (see Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

>*Source*: M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae  
>*Transcription*: <cite>M. AccI Plauti quae supersunt Comoediae</cite>

<a name="0G2.4">0G2.4</a> **Chronograms**. Capital letters occurring apparently at random or in a
particular sequence on a title page or in a colophon may represent a chronogram.
Where there is good reason to assume that a chronogram is being used, do not
convert letters considered part of the chronogram from uppercase to lowercase,
or from lowercase to uppercase (see also 4D2.2 xxlinkxx).

#### 0G3. Punctuation in the source

<a name="0G3.1">0G3.1</a> **General rule**. Do not necessarily transcribe punctuation as it appears in
the source. Instead, follow modern punctuation conventions, using common
sense in deciding whether to include the punctuation, omit it, replace it, or add
punctuation not present.

>*Source*: The unhappy favourite; or, The Earl of Essex. A tragedy. Written by Jno; Banks  
>*Transcription*: <cite>The unhappy favourite, or, The Earl of Essex : a tragedy / written by Jno. Banks</cite>

>*Transcription*: <cite>London : Printed for A. Millar, over-against Catharine-Street in the Strand, MDCCLI [1751]</cite>  

**Alternative rule**: Transcribe all punctuation as found in the source of information,
with the exception of those marks covered in rules 0G3.5‐0G3.7. When following
this alternative rule, always include prescribed punctuation as well, even if this
results in double punctuation. Prescribed punctuation is treated at the beginning of
each chapter within these rules.

><cite>The unhappy favourite; or, The Earl of Essex. : A tragedy. / Written by Jno; Banks</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: Commas are not added around or when applying this option; commas surrounding a conjunction introducing an alternative title is an AACR2 convention, not prescribed ISBD punctuation.)

<a name="0G3.2">0G3.2</a> **Apostrophes**. Transcribe apostrophes as found. Do not supply
apostrophes not present in the source.

<a name="0G3.3">0G3.3</a> **Hyphens**. Transcribe hyphens used to connect the constituent parts of
compound words, normalizing their form as necessary (see Appendix G2 xxlinkxx). Do
not supply hyphens not present in the source.

<a name="0G3.4">0G3.4</a> **Punctuation within roman numerals**. Do not transcribe internal marks of
punctuation appearing within roman numerals. Omit them without using the
mark of omission.

<a name="0G3.5">0G3.5</a> **Ellipses, square brackets, and virgules.** Do not transcribe ellipses **...** or
square brackets **[ ]** when present in the source; replace them with a dash **‐‐** and
parentheses **( )** respectively or omit them, as appropriate. Do not confuse a
virgule (/) in gothic typefaces with a slash; replace it with a comma or omit it, as
appropriate. Make an explanatory note, if considered important.

>*Transcription*: <cite>Leominster, Mass.</cite>  
>Optional note: <cite>On t.p., "Mass." is enclosed by square brackets</cite> 

<a name="0G3.6">0G3.6</a> **Line endings**. Do not transcribe a hyphen or other mark of punctuation
used to connect a single word divided between two lines; transcribe as a single
word, ignoring the punctuation. If the function of the hyphen is in doubt (e.g., if
it might form part of a compound word), transcribe it.

<a name="0G3.7">0G3.7</a> **Punctuation substituting for letters**. Transcribe as hyphens any hyphens,
dashes, or underscore characters used in the source as a substitute for one or
more letters in a word or an entire word. Use one hyphen for each distinct piece
of type.

#### 0G4. Spacing

<a name="0G4.1">0G4.1</a> **Spacing within words and numbers**. In general, follow modern spacing
conventions when transcribing from the source. Make no attempt to preserve full
or irregular spaces between letters within words. If a word is divided between
the end of one line and the beginning of the next, transcribe it as a single word,
ignoring the line‐break.

Omit internal spaces when transcribing numbers (including roman numerals).

>*Source*: G R AE C AE GRAMMATICES  
>*Transcription*: <cite>Graecae grammatices</cite>

>DE LAVDI  
>BVS VRBIS ETRVRIAE  
>ET ITALIAE  
>*Transcription*: <cite>De laudibus urbis Etruriae et Italiae</cite>  

**Alternative rule**: Transcribe internal spaces within numbers (including roman
numerals). If multiple spaces or different sizes of spaces appear between two
characters within the number, transcribe them as a single space.

>*Transcription*: <cite>M. D. CC. XLIV</cite>

<a name="0G4.2">0G4.2</a> **Spacing between words**. If spacing between words in the source is
ambiguous, or lacking, include spaces in the transcription to separate the words
as needed.<sup>8</sup>

<small><sup>8</sup> If the missing spaces occur in the first five words of the title proper, provide additional title
access for the form of title as it appears in the source, without the spaces (see Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

>*Transcription*: <cite>La morte d'Orfeo</cite>  

<a name="0G4.3">0G4.3</a> **Variant spellings**. Do not insert spaces within single words that merely
represent variant or archaic spellings.<sup>9</sup>

<small><sup>9</sup> If the variant or archaic spellings occur in the first five words of the title proper, provide
additional title access for the form of the title with the spacing inserted (see Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

#### 0G5. Omissions

<a name="0G5.1">0G5.1</a> **General rule**. Indicate omissions in the transcription or in a quoted note
by using the mark of omission. When using the mark of omission, generally give
it with a space on either side. However, give a space on only one side if the mark
comes at the end of an area, is preceded by an opening parenthesis or opening
square bracket, or is followed by a closing parenthesis, closing square bracket, or
comma.

><cite>Amsterdam : Printed for the Widow Swart ..., 1688</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: The mark of omission has a space on only one side because it is
followed by a comma)

<a name="0G5.2">0G5.2</a> **Information not considered part of any area**. If omitting grammatically
separable information from the transcription because it is not considered part of
any area (pious invocations, etc.; see 1A2.2 xxlinkxx), do not use the mark of omission. If
considered important, give the omitted information in a note.

<a name="0G5.3">0G5.3</a> **Information not taken from the chief source of information**. If
transcribing information from a source other than the chief source of
information, omit any words preceding or following the information if they are
not considered part of the element and are grammatically separable. Do not use
the mark of omission. If considered important, give the omitted text in a note.

><cite>The second edition</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Edition statement from colophon; full colophon reads: This, the second edition of Le morte Darthur, with Aubrey Beardsley's designs ... is limited to 1000 copies for the United Kingdom and 500 for America, after printing which the type has been distributed</cite>  

#### 0G6. Interpolations

<a name="0G6.1">0G6.1</a> **General rule**. Indicate an interpolation in the transcription or in a quoted
note by enclosing it in square brackets. If transcribing text with missing or
obscured letters or words that can be reconstructed with some certainty, include
these in the transcription, enclosing them in square brackets. Make an
explanatory note, if considered important.

><cite>amico[rum]</cite>
>>(*Comment*: The word ends with a &lt;IMAGE NOT AVAILABLE&gt;)

<a name="0G6.2">0G6.2</a> **Conjectural and indecipherable text**. Indicate a conjectural interpolation
by adding a question mark immediately after the interpolation, within the square
brackets. Supply a question mark enclosed in square brackets for each
indeterminable word or portion of word. Make a note to justify the
interpolations, provide explanations, or offer tentative readings of
indecipherable portions of text, if considered important.

<a name="0G6.3">0G6.3</a> **Lacunae in imperfect copies**. If the description is based on an imperfect
copy (see 0B2.2 xxlinkxx), use the mark of omission enclosed in square brackets ([...]) to
show lacunae in the resource.

>Note: <cite>Description based on an imperfect copy; title page torn with partial loss of imprint</cite>  

<a name="0G6.4">0G6.4</a> **Blank spaces**. If transcribing text containing a blank space intended to be
completed in manuscript, as is common in forms and certain government
documents, supply the word "blank" enclosed in square brackets.<sup>10</sup> If the blank
has been completed in the item being described, indicate this in a local note, if
considered important.

<small><sup>10</sup> If the blank occurs in the first five words of the title proper, provide additional title access
for the form of title without the interpolated word "[blank]" (see Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

<a name="0G6.5">0G6.5</a> **Adjacent elements within a single area**. If adjacent elements within one
area are to be enclosed in square brackets, generally enclose them in one set of
square brackets.

><cite>[Leipzig : W. Stürmer], 1572</cite>

If the square brackets are due to interpolations such as corrections or expansions
(see 0G8.2, 4B3, 4B4, 4B5 xxlinkxx), however, use separate pairs of square brackets.

><cite>Lugduni [Lyon] : [Philippe Tighi?], 1573</cite>

#### 0G7. Misprints, etc.

<a name="0G7.1">0G7.1</a> **Misprints**. Transcribe a misprint as it appears in the publication. Follow
such an inaccuracy either by "[sic]" or by the abbreviation "i.e." and the
correction within square brackets.<sup>11</sup>

<small><sup>11</sup> If the misprint occurs in the first five words of the title proper, provide additional title
access for the form of title without the interpolation and for the form of title as if it had been
printed correctly (see Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

><cite>The notted [i.e. noted] history of Mother Grim</cite>  

><cite>One day's dty [i.e. duty]</cite>  

Do not correct words spelled according to older or non‐standard orthographic
conventions, e.g., "françoise" for "française," or "antient" for "ancient."

<a name="0G7.2">0G7.2</a> **Turned and approximated letters**. Transcribe a turned letter (i.e., a letter
set upside‐down), whether inadvertent or deliberate, as the intended letter.
Transcribe two letters used to approximate a third letter as the intended letter.
However, transcribe **vv** as **vv** (see Appendix G5 xxlinkxx). Make an explanatory note, if
considered important.<sup>12</sup>

<small><sup>12</sup> If the two letters used to approximate a third letter occur in the first five words of the title
proper, provide additional title access for the form of title with the letters transcribed as set (see
Appendix F xxlinkxx).</small>

<a name="0G7.3">0G7.3</a> **Blank spaces for initial letters**. When the printer has left a blank space for
an initial letter, supply the intended letter in square brackets, regardless of
whether the letter has been executed in manuscript, and make an explanatory
note. If a guide letter has been printed, transcribe it without square brackets. In
case of doubt about whether a printed guide letter is present, transcribe the letter
without square brackets. Make a local note to indicate the presence or absence of
manuscript execution in the copy, if considered important.

#### 0G8. Abbreviations and contractions

<a name="0G8.1">0G8.1</a> When transcribing from the publication, do not abbreviate any words not
abbreviated in the source.

<a name="0G8.2">0G8.2</a> If special marks of contraction have been used by the printer in
continuance of the manuscript tradition, expand affected words to their full form
and enclose supplied letters in square brackets (see Appendix G3 xxlinkxx). Make an
explanatory note, if considered important (see 7B4.2 xxlinkxx). If a contraction standing
for an entire word appears in the source, supply instead the word itself, enclosed
in square brackets. However, transcribe an ampersand or a Tironian sign (&lt;IMAGE NOT AVAILABLE&gt;) as
an ampersand. Enclose each expansion or supplied word in its own set of square
brackets.

><cite>Esopus co[n]structus moralizat[us] & hystoriatus ad vtilitate[m] discipulo[rum]</cite>

If the meaning of a contraction is conjectural, apply the bracketing conventions
given in 0G6.2 xxlinkxx.

#### 0G9. Superscripts and subscripts

Transcribe superscript and subscript characters on the line unless the sense
would be affected (e.g., in a mathematical formula).

## 1. TITLE AND STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY AREA

### Contents:

1A. Preliminary rule  
1B. Title proper  
1C. Parallel titles  
1D. Other title information  
1E. Statements of responsibility    
1F. Publications without a collective title  
1G. Single‐sheet publications  

### 1A. Preliminary rule  

#### 1A1. Prescribed punctuation  

For instructions on the use of spaces before and after prescribed punctuation, see
0E xxlinkxx.

Precede the title of a supplement or section (see 1B6 xxlinkxx) by a period.

Precede each parallel title by an equals sign.

Precede each unit of other title information by a colon.

Precede the first statement of responsibility by a diagonal slash.

Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon.

For the punctuation of this area when a publication has no collective title, see 1F xxlinkxx.

#### 1A2. Sources of information

<a name="1A2.1">1A2.1</a> **General rule**. The prescribed source of information for the title and
statement of responsibility area is the title page. For special provisions relating to
single‐sheet publications, see 1G xxlinkxx.

<a name="1A2.2">1A2.2</a> **Omission of pious invocations, etc**. Omit, without using the mark of
omission, information found on the title page that constitutes neither title
information nor a statement of responsibility. Such information may include
pious invocations, quotations, devices, announcements, epigrams, mottoes,
prices, etc. (see 0G5.2 xxlinkxx). Transcribe or describe this kind of information in a note if
it is considered important. If such information is a grammatically inseparable
part (see 1B1 xxlinkxx) of one of the elements of the title and statement of responsibility
area, however, transcribe it as such. If such information constitutes the only titlelike
information present in the source, it may be used as a devised title according
to the provisions of 1B5 xxlinkxx.

<a name="1A2.3">1A2.3</a> **Multipart monographs**. If the volume is part of a multipart monograph,
and the title page gives a statement of the volume or part number within the
larger work, omit this statement without using the mark of omission, unless it is
a grammatically inseparable part (see 1B1, 1B4 xxlinkxx) of the information being
transcribed. Do transcribe statements such as "in two volumes," however (see
1D3 xxlinkxx).

#### 1A3. Form and order of information

Transcribe title and statement of responsibility information in the form and order
in which it is presented in the source, unless instructed otherwise by specific
rules (see 0G xxlinkxx).

### 1B. Title proper

#### 1B1. Words considered part of the title proper

<a name="1B1.1">1B1.1</a> The title proper is the first element of the description. Title information
preceding the chief title on the title page is considered part of the title proper. If
the chief title is preceded or followed in the source by other elements of
information, transpose these elements to their appropriate areas in the
description (or give them in a note) unless case endings would be affected, the
grammatical construction of the information would be disturbed, or the text is
otherwise grammatically inseparable from the title proper. In the latter cases,
transcribe the information as part of the title proper.

><cite>The post-humous works of Robert Hooke</cite>

><cite>Monsieur Bossu's treatise of the epicke poem</cite> 

><cite>M. Tullii Ciceronis de officiis libri tres</cite>

><cite>Bell's edition of Shakspere</cite>

<a name="1B1.2">1B1.2</a> Make a note to indicate the original position on the title page of
transposed elements.

><cite>Prudence Palfrey : a novel / Thomas Bailey Aldrich</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Author's name at head of title</cite>

#### 1B2. Note on the source of the title proper

Make a note on the source of the title proper if it is a title page substitute, e.g., the
caption title, docket title, etc.

><cite>A new list of fifty two ships sent to the East-Indies</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Docket title</cite>

#### 1B3. Forms of the title proper

The title proper can take a variety of forms, some of which are exemplified
below:

<a name="1B3.1">1B3.1</a> Title proper inclusive of other titles or other title information appearing
before the chief title on the title page:

><cite>Seculum Davidicum redivivum, The divine right of the revolution scripturally and rationally evinced and applied  
>>(*Comment*: By virtue of its typographical prominence, the English title is clearly the chief title)

><cite>Prize dissertation, which was honored with the Magellanic Gold Medal, by the American Philosophical Society, January, 1793. Cadmus, or, A treatise on the elements of written language  
>>(*Comment*: "Cadmus …" is clearly more prominent than "Prize dissertation …")  

><cite>Hereafter foloweth a litel boke called Colyn Cloute</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: "Colyn Cloute" is the chief title)

<a name="1B3.2">1B3.2</a> Title proper inclusive of alternative titles:

><cite>Christianographie, or, The description of the multitude and sundry sorts of Christians in the vvorld not subject to the Pope</cite>

<a name="1B3.3">1B3.3</a> Title proper consisting solely of the name of a responsible person or body:
><cite>Salustius</cite>

<a name="1B3.4">1B3.4</a> Title proper inclusive of a caption. (See 1G4 xxlinkxx for caption titles on singlesheet
publications):

>*Source*: To the Honourable Commissioners appointed by Act of Parliament for enquiring into the Losses and Services of the American Loyalists. The memorial of Silvester Gardiner humbly sheweth, ...  
>*Transcription*: <cite>To the Honourable Commissioners appointed by act of Parliament for enquiring into the losses and services of the American loyalists. The memorial of Silvester Gardiner humbly sheweth ...</cite>

#### 1B4. Title proper with grammatically inseparable designation

If a publication is in more than one volume and the title proper of each volume
includes a grammatically inseparable designation such as numbering that is
specific to that volume, supply in square brackets after the first designation a
hyphen and the final designation, omitting intermediate designations. Do the
same for single‐volume publications that contain multiple parts.

><cite>Quinti Horatii Flacci epistolarum liber primus[-secundus]</cite>  

><cite>Thomas Masterson his first[-second] booke of arithmeticke</cite>  

><cite>Le premier[-quart] volume de messire Jehan Froissart lequel traicte des choses dignes de memoire aduenues tant es pays de France, Angleterre, Flanders, Espaigne que Escoce, et autres lieux circonuoisins</cite>

If it is not feasible to do this, transcribe the title proper of the first volume or part
without this interpolation and make a note about the later designation(s).

#### 1B5. No title proper

If no title can be found in any source, use as the title proper the opening words of
the text if these provide a reasonably distinctive title. If the opening words of the
text are not suitable, or if the beginning of the text is lacking, devise a brief
descriptive title, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency,
and use this devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the title proper. Make a
note indicating whether the title proper is taken from the opening words of the
text or has been devised by the cataloger.

><cite>I am a jolly huntsman, my voice is shrill and clear</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Title from opening two lines of poem</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: Title is not bracketed because the first page of text is here the title page
substitute)  

><cite>[Observations on a bill relative to the militia]</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Title devised from content</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: Opening words "Herewith and the desire of being serviceable in the smallest degree to my country ..." not suitable as title)

><cite>[Sermon on Christian baptism]</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Title devised from content of sermon</cite>  

#### 1B6. Title proper with supplementary or section designation or title

If the title proper for a work that is supplementary to, or a section of, another
work appears in two or more grammatically separable parts, transcribe the title
of the main work first, followed by the designation(s) and/or title(s) of the
supplement(s) or section(s) in order of their dependence. Make a note indicating
the original position on the title page of any transposed elements.

><cite>Faust. Part one</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Title page reads: Part one. Faust</cite>  

If describing an individual issue of a serial, transcribe the numbering of the issue
as instructed in Appendix H xxlinkxx.

#### 1B7. Abridgments of the title proper

<a name="1B7.1">1B7.1</a> **General rule**. Abridge a long title proper only if it can be done without
loss of essential information. Do not omit any of the first five words. Indicate
omissions by the mark of omission.

><cite>An act or law passed by the General Court or Assembly of His Majesty's English colony of Connecticut ... on the seventh day of February ... 1759</cite>

<a name="1B7.2">1B7.2</a> **Alternative title**. If the title proper contains an alternative title, do not
omit any of the first five words of the alternative title.

><cite>England's alarm, or, A most humble declaration, address, and fervent petition ...</cite>

<a name="1B7.3">1B7.3</a> **Chief title**. Extend the transcription of the title proper at least through the
end of the chief title of the resource. Apply this provision even if other words in
the title proper precede the chief title (see 1B1.1, 1B3.1 xxlinkxx). If the end of the chief title
cannot be determined, break off the transcription at the first grammatically
acceptable place, but in no event within the first five words of the chief title.

><cite>Jo. Danielis Schoepflini consil. reg. ac Franciae historiogr. vindiciae typographicae</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: The chief title is "Vindiciae typographicae")

><cite>A brand new song, entitled The Irishman's address to the twenty-six Nottingham worthies ...</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: The chief title begins "The Irishmanʹs address" but its ending is ambiguous)

### 1C. Parallel titles

#### 1C1. Order and source of parallel titles

Transcribe parallel titles in the order indicated by their sequence on, or by the
layout of, the title page. If the original title appears elsewhere than on the title
page, transcribe it in a note, if considered important.

#### 1C2. Language of parallel titles and relationship to title proper

<a name="1C2.1">1C2.1</a> Transcribe an original title in a language different from that of the title
<a name="1C2.1">1C2.1</a> Transcribe an original title in a language different from that of the title
proper appearing on the title page as a parallel title, unless it is grammatically
inseparable from another part of the description.

><cite>Fables = Fabulae</cite>

<a name="1C2.2">1C2.2</a> Transcribe as other title information an original title in the same language
as the title proper (see 1D xxlinkxx).

><cite>The adventures of Red Riding Hood : Little Red Riding Hood</cite>

### 1D. Other title information

#### 1D1. Order and source of other title information

Transcribe other title information appearing on the title page in the order
indicated by the sequence on, or layout of, the title page. Transcribe other title
information not appearing on the title page in a note, if considered important.

#### 1D2. Other title information beginning with prepositions, conjunctions, etc.

<a name="1D2.1">1D2.1</a> **General rule**. Transcribe title information that appears following the title
proper as other title information, even if it begins with a preposition,
conjunction, prepositional phrase, etc.

><cite>The English Parliament represented in a vision : with an afterthought upon the speech delivered to His Most Christian Majesty by the deputies of the states of Britany on the 29th day of February last ... : to which is added at large the memorable representation of the House of Commons to the Queen in the year 1711/12 ...</cite>

<a name="1D2.2">1D2.2</a> If this other title information appears following the statement of
responsibility, transcribe it as a subsequent statement of responsibility (see
1E14.2 xxlinkxx).

<a name="1D2.3">1D2.3</a>. If this other title information, or some portion of it, constitutes a formal
statement of the contents of the work, and is grammatically separable from the
title proper and other title information, transcribe it in a note, if considered
important (see 7B16.2 xxlinkxx). When these formal statements are omitted from the title
and statement of responsibility area, use the mark of omission.

><cite>The spinning wheel's garland : containing several excellent new songs ...</cite>  
>Optional note: <cite>Contents: (from t.p.) I. The good housewife's coat of arms -- II. The spinning wheels glory -- III. The taylor disappointed of his bride -- IV. The changeable world</cite> 

<a name="1D2.4">1D2.4</a> Distinguish the above situations from those in which titles of other works
are given equal prominence with the first‐named work (see 1F1 xxlinkxx).

#### 1D3. Statements about illustrations or volumes

Treat an illustration statement or a statement such as "in two volumes" as other
title information, unless the statement is grammatically inseparable from
information transcribed as part of another element or area (see 1E13 and 2B8 xxlinkxx). If
the statement appears following the statement of responsibility, transcribe it as a
subsequent statement of responsibility.

><cite>The American child's pictorial history of the United States : illustrated by sixty engravings General index to fifty-six volumes of the Gentleman's magazine : from its commencement in the year 1731 to the end of 1786 / compiled by Samuel Ayscough, clerk, assistant librarian of the British Museum ; in two volumes</cite>

#### 1D4. Abridgment of other title information

*Optionally*, if other title information is very lengthy and can be abridged without
loss of essential information, omit less important words or phrases, using the
mark of omission. If considered important, transcribe omitted words or phrases
in a note (including the other titles or phrases referred to in 1D2.3 xxlinkxx).

#### 1D5. Other title information with grammatically inseparable elements

If the other title information includes a statement of responsibility or an element
belonging to another area, and the element is a grammatically inseparable part of
the other title information according to one or more of the conditions
enumerated in 1B1.1 xxlinkxx, transcribe it as other title information.

><cite>Constitutiones legitime seu legatine regionis Anglicane : cu[m] subtilissima interpretatione d[omi]ni Johannis de Athon</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: Statement of responsibility transcribed as part of other title information because of genitive case ending)

#### 1D6. Parallel statements containing other title information

Transcribe parallel statements containing other title information in the order in
which they appear on the title page.

### 1E. Statements of responsibility

#### 1E1. Statements of responsibility on the title page

Transcribe statements of responsibility found on the title page in the form in
which they appear.

><cite>Thoughts on education / by the late Bishop Burnet</cite>

><cite>Moore's Irish melodies / illustrated by D. Maclise, R.A.</cite>

#### 1E2. Statements of responsibility on other sources

If a statement of responsibility appears in a source other than on the title page, or
is taken from outside the publication, record the statement and its source in a
note.

>Note: <cite>Pref. signed: Thomas Hopkins</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: Hopkins is not recorded in the statement of responsibility area even though he is known to be the author)

>Note: <cite>"By an engineer"--Introd.</cite>

#### 1E3. Transposition of statements of responsibility

If a statement of responsibility precedes the title proper in the source, transpose it
to its required position unless it is a grammatically inseparable part of the title
proper according to one or more of the conditions enumerated in 1B1.1 xxlinkxx. When
transposing the statement of responsibility, do not use the mark of omission.
Make a note indicating the transposition.

#### 1E4. Single statements of responsibility with two or more names

<a name="1E4.1">1E4.1</a> Transcribe a single statement of responsibility as such whether the two or
more persons or corporate bodies named in it perform the same function or
different functions.

both names and the words indicative of their function as part of a single
statement of responsibility (unless grammatically inseparable from the title
proper or other title information).

*but* 

><cite>De peripneumonia disputationem ... sub praesidio ... Dn. Jacobi Fabricii ... publice examinandam proponit Johannes Hellinger</cite>

#### 1E5. Omission of names in statements of responsibility

When a single statement of responsibility names more than one person or
corporate body performing the same function or with the same degree of
responsibility, transcribe all the names mentioned. *Optionally*, if the responsible
persons or bodies named in a single statement are considered too numerous to
list exhaustively, all after the third may be omitted. Indicate the omission by the
mark of omission, and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language
and script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission.

><cite>/ idee e motti di Giannino Antona-Traversi ; disegni di G. Ardy, A. Bonzagni, A. Cagnoni ... [and 7 others] ; sculture di V. Franco</cite>

#### 1E6. Two or more statements of responsibility

If there are two or more statements of responsibility, transcribe them in the order
indicated by their sequence on, or by the layout of, the title page. If the sequence
and layout are ambiguous or insufficient to determine the order, transcribe the
statements in the order that makes the most sense.

><cite>El Fuero Real de España / diligentemente hecho por el noble Rey don Alonso noveno ; glossado por Alonso Díaz de Montalvo ...</cite>

#### 1E7. Terms of address, etc., in statements of responsibility

Include titles and abbreviations of titles of nobility, address, honor, and

><cite>/ by the Rev. Daniel Lysons ...</cite>

#### 1E8. Qualifications in statements of responsibility

Qualifications such as initials indicating membership in societies, academic degrees, and statements of positions held may be omitted from the statement of responsibility, using the mark of omission, unless:  
the qualifications are necessary grammatically  
*or*  
the qualifications are necessary for identifying the person or are useful in establishing a context for the person’s activity (initials of religious orders, phrases, or adjectives denoting place names, etc.)  
*or*   
the statement of responsibility represents the author only by a pseudonym, a descriptive phrase, or nonalphabetic symbols.

#### 1E9. Ambiguous statements of responsibility

If the relationship between the title of a work and the person(s) or body (bodies)
named in the statement of responsibility is not clear, supply an explanatory word
or short phrase in the language of the text, within square brackets, or make a
note.

><cite>De l'humour noir / [compilé par] André Breton</cite>

If considered important, make a note about expansions, explanations, and
corrections of statements of responsibility when needed for clarity (see 7B6 xxlinkxx).

#### 1E10. Statements of responsibility following titles in more than one language or script

<a name="1E10.1">1E10.1</a> If there are titles in more than one language or script, but only a single
statement of responsibility, transcribe the statement of responsibility after all the
title information.

><cite>Jeux de cartes pour enfants = Children's playing cards / par Giovanni Belgrado et Bruno Munari</cite>

<a name="1E10.2">1E10.2</a>. If there are both titles and statements of responsibility in more than one
language or script, transcribe each statement of responsibility after the title
proper, parallel title, or other title information to which it relates. If any of these
titles lack a matching statement of responsibility, transcribe the information in
the order indicated by the sequence on, or by the layout of, the title page.

><cite>Anatomia uteri humani gravidi tabulis illustrata / auctore Gulielmo Hunter ... = The anatomy of the human gravid uterus exhibited in figures / by William Hunter</cite>

<a name="1E10.3">1E10.3</a> Make a note to indicate the original position on the source of any
transposed statements.

#### 1E11. Nouns and noun phrases

<a name="1E11.1">1E11.1</a> Treat a noun or noun phrase occurring in conjunction with a statement of
responsibility as other title information if it is indicative of the nature of the
work.

><cite>Comus : a mask / by John Milton</cite>

<a name="1E11.2">1E11.2</a>. If the noun or noun phrase is indicative of the role of the person(s) or
body (bodies) named in the statement of responsibility rather than of the nature
of the work, treat it as part of the statement of responsibility.

><cite>Paradise lost : a poem in twelve books / the author John Milton</cite>

><cite>A cushion of downe / text by Gilbert Frye ; drawings by Charles Cox</cite>

><cite>Life and adventures of Valentine Vox, the ventriloquist / with illustrations by Phiz</cite>

<a name="1E11.3">1E11.3</a> In case of doubt, treat the noun or noun phrase as part of the statement of
responsibility.

#### 1E12. Persons or bodies not explicitly named in statements of responsibility

Transcribe a statement of responsibility as such even if no person or body is
explicitly named in that statement. Such statements will generally contain words
like "translated," "edited," "compiled," etc.

><cite>The folovving of Christ / translated out of Latin into English</cite>

#### 1E13. Statements of responsibility with grammatically inseparable elements

If the statement of responsibility includes information belonging to another area,
and the information is grammatically inseparable from the statement of
responsibility according to one or more of the conditions enumerated in 1B1.1 xxlinkxx,
transcribe it as part of the statement of responsibility.

><cite>L'hymne au soleil / traduit en vers latins, sur la troisième édition du texte françois, par M. l'abbé Métivier</cite>

#### 1E14. Phrases about notes, appendixes, etc.

<a name="1E14.1">1E14.1</a> Transcribe phrases about notes, appendixes, and such accompanying
matter in the order indicated by the sequence on the title page. If such
information appears before the statement of responsibility, transcribe it as other
title information (see 1D2.1 xxlinkxx).

><cite>Chemische Erfahrungen bey meinem und andern Fabriken in Deutschland : nebst einem Anhang besonderer chemischer
Geheimnisse / von J.A. Weber</cite>

><cite>Clarion call : with Franklin Phelps' criticisms / by Lunceford Yates</cite>

<a name="1E14.2">1E14.2</a> If such information appears after the statement of responsibility,
transcribe it as a subsequent statement of responsibility, whether or not it names
a person or body.

><cite>High life below stairs : a farce / by James Townley ; with a variety of German notes explanatory of the idioms ... alluded to by John Christian Huttner</cite>

<a name="1E14.3">1E14.3</a> *Optionally*, if the phrases are very lengthy and can be abridged without
loss of essential information, omit less important words or phrases, using the
mark of omission. If considered important, transcribe omitted phrases in a note.
If the phrases are actually titles of other works given equal prominence with the
title of the first work, see 1F xxlinkxx.

### 1F. Publications without a collective title

#### 1F1. Two or more works named on the title page

<a name="1F1.1">1F1.1</a> By same person or body. If the publication has no collective title and the
title page bears the titles of two or more individual works, other than
supplementary matter, that are contained in the publication, transcribe the titles
of the individual works in the order in which they appear on the title page.
Separate the titles by a space‐semicolon‐space if the works are all by the same
person(s) or body (bodies), even if the titles are linked by a connecting word or
phrase.

><cite>Les Akanças : prologue mélo-dramatique, en un acte et en prose ; suivi Des Espagnols dans la Floride : pantomime en trois actes et à spectacle</cite>

<a name="1F1.2">1F1.2</a> By different persons or bodies. If the individual works are by different
persons or bodies, or the authorship is in doubt, precede each title other than the
first by a period and one space, unless a linking word or phrase is already
present. Precede each statement of responsibility by a space‐slash‐space.

><cite>The serving-man become a queen. Jockey of the green. The lass of Richmond Hill</cite>

><cite>Franklin’s way to wealth and Penn’s maxims</cite>

#### 1F2. One or more works not named on the title page

If the publication has no collective title, and one or more works contained in the
publication are not named on the title page:

transcribe the title and statement of responsibility from the title page, and name the other work(s) in a contents note (see 7B16 xxlinkxx)  
*or*  
make a separate description for each separately titled work, linking the separate descriptions with "With" notes (see 7B18 xxlinkxx)  
*or*  
devise a collective title for the whole publication, preferably in the language and script of the cataloging agency, and use this devised title, enclosed in square brackets, as the title proper 

><cite>[Acts of Parliament enacted in 1732]</cite>

### 1G. Single‐sheet publications

#### 1G1. Chief source of information

The chief source of information for single‐sheet publications is the whole sheet,
recto and verso.

#### 1G2. General rule

In general, transcribe the information presented beginning with the first line of
printing. If the printing is arranged in columns with no information preceding
the body of the text, begin the transcription with the top line of the extreme left
column (extreme right column in the case of languages that are read right to left).
Retain in the transcription dates, addresses, and other information necessary for
identification. Use judgment, but in case of doubt, start the transcription with the
first words of printed text on the sheet. If the initial text is grammatically
independent of the succeeding material and is one of the following, however,
begin the transcription after it without using the mark of omission:
* caption to an illustration
* copyright statement
* device
* edition statement
* publication, distribution, etc., statement
* motto
* official numbering
* page number
* part of an illustration or ornament
* price
* tabular material

If the initial text has been omitted, indicate the nature and position of the omitted
material in a note, if considered important.

#### 1G3. Chief title

If there is a word or phrase obviously intended as the chief title of the publication
that is not the first line of printing, transcribe it as the entire title proper, omitting
information appearing before it on the page without the mark of omission. In
general, apply this instruction only when such a title is not integrated
grammatically with the rest of the text, is set off typographically, and has as its
sole function the naming of the piece as a whole. When such a title is selected,
also give in a note at least the first five words of the first line of printing as
described above. In case of doubt as to the selection of the chief title, start the
transcription with the first line as described above.

#### 1G4. Caption title

If a caption title is present, normally transcribe this title in full. If there is no
caption title, transcribe the text as found at least until a relatively distinctive
word or phrase is included. If the distinctive word or phrase is not near the
beginning of the transcription, less important words or phrases preceding it may
be omitted, using the mark of omission. Do not, however, abridge the
transcription before the sixth word. If the text is very lengthy, end the
transcription at the first grammatically acceptable place after the caption title or
the distinctive word or phrase; the omitted material may be summarized in a
note, if considered important.

#### 1G5. Prescribed punctuation

Information transcribed from single‐sheet publications usually does not lend
itself to the application of the punctuation prescribed in 1A1 xxlinkxx for the title and
statement of responsibility area. If, however, the information can be separated
clearly and unmistakably into title proper, other title information, or statement of
responsibility without any transposition, supply the prescribed punctuation.

#### 1G6. Two or more works with a collective title

If there are two or more works printed on a single sheet having a collective title,
transcribe only the collective title as the title proper. Make a formal or informal
contents note for the works.

#### 1G7. Two or more works without a collective title

If there are two or more works printed on a single sheet that does not have a
collective title, transcribe as the title statement the first title or opening words of
the text. Make a formal or informal contents note and include in it the titles of the
additional works. If the sheet is printed on both sides and it is impossible to
determine which side should be read first, make a separate bibliographic record
for each side of the sheet, and include a formal "With, on verso" note in each
record (see 7B18 xxlinkxx).

#### 1G8. Two or more works with separate publication, distribution, etc., statements

If there are two or more works printed on a single sheet and each has its own
publication, distribution, etc., statement, or there is other conclusive evidence
that they were intended to be separately issued, make a separate bibliographic
record for each work that was intended to be issued separately. Include a formal
"With" note in each record (see 7B18 xxlinkxx) indicating that the works were printed on a
single sheet and that they were "intended to be separated." If there are two or
more works printed on a single sheet giving the appearance that they were
possibly intended to be separated, but there is no conclusive evidence that this is
the case, follow the provisions of 1G7 xxlinkxx, and include a note indicating that they
were "possibly intended to be separated."

## 2. EDITION AREA

### Contents:

2A. Preliminary rule  
2B. Edition statement  
2C. Statements of responsibility relating to the edition  
2D. Statement relating to a named revision of an edition  
2E. Statements of responsibility relating to a named revision of an edition  

### 2A. Preliminary rule

#### 2A1. Prescribed punctuation

For instructions on the use of spaces before and after prescribed punctuation, see
0E xxlinkxx.

Precede the edition area by a period‐space‐dash‐space.

Precede a statement relating to a named revision of an edition by a comma.

Precede the first statement of responsibility following an edition statement by a
diagonal slash.

Precede each subsequent statement of responsibility by a semicolon.

For the use of the equals sign to precede parallel statements, see the appropriate
rules following.

#### 2A2. Sources of information

The prescribed sources of information for the edition area are the title page, other
preliminaries, colophon, and dust jacket (see introductory section IX.2 xxlinkxx), in that
order of preference. If an edition statement or any part of the edition area is
transcribed from elsewhere than the title page, indicate its source in a note.

><cite>The third edition corrected, and considerably enlarged</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Edition statement from half-title</cite>

><cite>Book Club edition</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Edition statement from dust jacket</cite>

#### 2A3. Form and order of information

Transcribe edition information in the form and order in which it is presented in
the source, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules (see 0G xxlinkxx).

### 2B. Edition statement

#### 2B1. General rule

Transcribe a statement relating to an edition or issue of a publication as it
appears, according to the general rules 0B‐0G. Include any explanatory words or
phrases appearing with the edition statement.

#### 2B2. Words considered part of the edition statement

<a name="2B2.1">2B2.1</a> Edition statements normally include either the word "edition" (or its
equivalent in other languages), or a related term such as "revision" or "issue."

><cite>The second edition</cite>

><cite>Cinquiesme édition, reueuë, corrigée, & augmentée</cite>

><cite>Nunc primum in lucem aedita</cite>

><cite>Editio secunda auctior et correctior</cite>

<a name="2B2.2">2B2.2</a> Treat a phrase such as "newly printed" as an edition statement unless it is
part of a statement being transcribed in the publication, distribution, etc., area. In
case of doubt, treat such a statement as an edition statement.

><cite>Newly imprinted and very necessary vnto all youthe</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: But transcribe a statement such as "Philadelphia printed, London reprinted" in the publication, distribution, etc., area rather than the edition area)

#### 2B3. Words such as "impression" or "printing"

<a name="2B3.1">2B3.1</a> Use judgment in transcribing statements containing words such as
"impression" or "printing." In books from the hand‐press era, such statements
usually signal a new edition or issue. In these cases, the statement may properly
be considered an edition statement.
><cite>The second impression</cite>

><cite>A new printing</cite>

<a name="2B3.2">2B3.2</a> In books from the machine‐press era, statements containing words such as
"impression" or "printing" are more likely to indicate that the publication is
simply a new impression of the same edition. Omit statements of impression
such as these from the transcription without using the mark of omission. Local
notes may be made about the statements, if considered important.

>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy has "ninth printing" on t.p. verso</cite>

**Alternative rule**: If a decision has been made to create a separate bibliographic
description for an individual impression, state, binding variant, or copy within a
single edition or issue (see introductory section X.1.4 xxlinkxx and Appendix E xxlinkxx), transcribe
statements containing words such as "impression" or "printing" in the edition area.
Indicate the source of the statement, if other than the title page, in a note.

><cite>Ninth printing</cite>  
>Note: <cite>The words "ninth printing" taken from t.p. verso</cite>  

#### 2B4. Edition statements with special characters or a numeric emphasis

<a name="2B4.1">2B4.1</a> If an edition statement consists entirely or chiefly of characters that are
neither numeric nor alphabetic, transcribe the characters as they appear if the
necessary typographical facilities are available. For characters that cannot be
reproduced, substitute the names or descriptions of the characters in square
brackets.

><cite>&&& edition</cite> 

><cite>[alpha chi] edition</cite>

<a name="2B4.2">2B4.2</a> If an edition statement consists of one or more letters or numbers without
accompanying words, or only words that convey numbers, supply an
appropriate word or abbreviation in square brackets. If no appropriate word or
abbreviation can be determined, or in cases of doubt, simply transcribe the
statement as found.

><cite>3e [éd.]</cite>

><cite>Second [ed.]</cite>

If such a statement signals a substantially unchanged impression of an edition,
omit it from the transcription without using the mark of omission. Local notes
may be made about such statements, if considered important.

>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy: "Fifth ten thousand"</cite>

>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy: Number "2" on t.p. indicates 2nd printing</cite>

>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy: "51st-100th"--T.p. verso</cite>

>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy: "163-173 Tausend"</cite>

>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy: Number line on t.p. verso indicates 3rd printing: "8 7 6 5 4 3 88 89 90 91 92"</cite>

>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy: Publisher's code "B-O" on t.p. verso indicates printed Feb. 1914; see Boutell, H.S. First editions (4th ed., rev. and enl.)</cite>

**Alternative rule**: If a decision has been made to create a separate bibliographic
description for an individual impression, state, binding variant, or copy within a
single edition or issue (see introductory section X.1.4 xxlinkxx and Appendix E xxlinkxx), transcribe
statements such as the following in the edition area, even if they represent a
substantially unchanged impression of that edition: a statement consisting entirely
or chiefly of characters that are neither numeric nor alphabetic; a statement
consisting of one or more letters or numbers without accompanying words; or a
statement consisting only of words that convey numbers. Supply appropriate words
or abbreviations in square brackets, as needed. Indicate the source of the statement,
if other than the title page, in a note.

><cite>51st-100th</cite>  
>Note: <cite>The words "51st-100th" taken from t.p. verso</cite>

If identification of the substantially unchanged impression is based on a publisherʹs
code or number line or on information found in a reference source, supply an
appropriate statement in square brackets, as needed. Indicate the basis for the
statement in a note.

><cite>[3rd printing]</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Number line on t.p. verso indicates 3rd printing: "8 7 6 5 4 3 88 89 90 91 92"

#### 2B5. No edition statement

<a name="2B5.1">2B5.1</a> If the publication does not contain an edition statement, but is known to
contain significant changes from other editions, or an edition statement for it is
provided by a reference source, do not supply an edition statement based on this
information. Give the information in a note.

>Note: <cite>"Sixth ed."--Tchemerzine, v. 6, p. 117-131</cite>

<a name="2B5.2">2B5.2</a> If the publication contains only a statement that refers to another edition
(e.g., as part of a preface to an earlier edition or a summary of the work’s
publication history), do not transcribe the information as an edition statement
and do not supply an edition statement based on the information. Notes may be
made on such statements, if considered important.

>Optional note: <cite>"Preface to the first edition": p. 5-7</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: The publication is not the first edition)

#### 2B6. Edition statements that are grammatically inseparable parts of other areas

If an edition statement is a grammatically inseparable part of another area
according to one or more of the conditions enumerated in 1B1.1 xxlinkxx, and has been
transcribed as such, do not repeat it as an edition statement.

><cite>Old New York, or, Reminiscences of the past sixty years : being an enlarged and revised edition of the anniversary discourse delivered before the New York Historical Society ...</cite>

><cite>Chirurgia / nunc iterum non mediocri studio atque diligentia a pluribus mendis purgata</cite>

#### 2B7. Transposition of edition statements

Transpose grammatically separable edition statements into the edition area from
other parts of the title page. Provide details of the transposition in a note.

#### 2B8. Edition statements with grammatically inseparable information

If information pertaining to other elements of the description (e.g., an original
title or other information concerning the original work) is grammatically
inseparable from the edition statement according to one or more of the
conditions enumerated in 1B1.1 xxlinkxx, transcribe it as part of the edition statement. If
illustration statements or statements such as "in two volumes" appear with an
edition statement, transcribe them as they appear (see also 1D3 xxlinkxx).

#### 2B9. Edition statements in more than one language or script

<a name="2B9.1">2B9.1</a> If the publication bears edition statements in more than one language or
script, transcribe the statement that is in the language or script of the title proper.
If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears first in the
source. Transcribe the remaining statement(s), together with any associated
statements of responsibility, as parallel edition statements. Precede each parallel
statement by an equals sign. Make a note to indicate the original position on the
source of any transposed statements.

<a name="2B9.2">2B9.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the parallel statements are too numerous
to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of
identification, omit parallel statements after the first using the mark of omission.
Transcribe the omitted statement(s) in a note, if considered important.

#### 2B10. Two or more works on the title page with at least one edition statement

If the title page bears the titles of two or more individual works contained in the
publication, and one or more of these works has an edition statement associated
with it, transcribe each edition statement in the title and statement of
responsibility area along with the title to which it pertains.

><cite>An examination of Dr. Burnet's theory of the earth ... / by J. Keill, The second edition corrected ... To the whole is annexed A dissertation on the different figures of coelestial bodies, &c ... / by Mons. de Maupertuis</cite>

#### 2B11. Edition statements on multipart monographs

<a name="2B11.1">2B11.1</a> If cataloging a multipart monograph, and the edition statement varies or
does not appear on all of the volumes, ascertain whether the set was issued as
such. If the publication was issued as such, base the transcription on the first
volume and make a note to indicate variation in, or absence of, the edition
statements in the subsequent volumes. In case of doubt, assume the set was not
issued as such.

><cite>Revised edition</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Vol. 2 issued without the edition statement</cite>

<a name="2B11.2">2B11.2</a> If the multipart monograph is known or assumed to be a made‐up set
(assembled from different editions by an owner) and reliable descriptions of the
editions are available, make separate descriptions for each edition. In each
description, make a local note indicating that the set is imperfect and identifying
which volumes are wanting.

><cite>Second edition</cite>  
>Local note: <cite>Library's copy imperfect: v. 2 wanting; a previous owner has supplied v. 2 from the 3rd ed. to create a made-up set</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: The first of two descriptions associated with the made‐up set)

><cite>Third edition</cite>  
>Local note: <cite>Library's copy imperfect; v. 1 wanting; a previous owner has supplied v. 1 from the 2nd ed. to create a made-up set</cite>  
>>(*Comment: The second of two descriptions associated with the made‐up set)

2B11.3. If the multipart monograph is known or assumed to be a made‐up set
and reliable descriptions of the editions are not available, base the description on
the copy in hand. Make a note to indicate that the description is based on a
made‐up set.

><cite>First edition</cite>  
>Note: <cite>Description based on a made-up set; v. 3 has "second edition"</cite>

### 2C. Statements of responsibility relating to the edition

#### 2C1. General rule

<a name="2C1.1">2C1.1</a> Transcribe a statement of responsibility relating to one or more editions,
but not to all editions, of a given work following the edition statement if there is
one. Such statements may include the reviser or illustrator of a new edition, or a
corporate body responsible for a new edition. Follow the instructions in 1E xxlinkxx for
the transcription and punctuation of such statements of responsibility.

><cite>The second edition / with notes of various authors by Thomas Newton</cite>

<a name="2C1.2">2C1.2</a> Do not, however, apply this provision to such statements that do not
name or otherwise identify a person or corporate body.

><cite>The second edition revised and corrected</cite>

*not* 

><cite>The second edition / revised and corrected</cite>

<a name="2C1.3">2C1.3</a> In determining the extent of the edition statement and the beginning of the
statement of responsibility relating to the edition, it may be necessary to take into
account the layout, punctuation, and typography of the title page as well as the
sense of the text. Such words as "Revised and enlarged," when appearing with
the name of a person or body, might be transcribed either as part of the edition
statement or as part of the statement of responsibility relating to the edition,
depending on their presentation on the title page.

#### 2C2. Transposition of statements of responsibility not relating to the edition

If a statement of responsibility appears after the edition statement, transpose it to
the title and statement of responsibility area in all cases except when it clearly
applies only to the edition being cataloged. Make a note to indicate this
transposition.

><cite>An inquiry into the original state and formation of the earth : deduced from facts about the laws of nature / by John
Whitehurst. -- The second edition, considerably enlarged, and illustrated with plates</cite>  
>Note: <cite>The statement "by John Whitehurst" appears on the t.p. after the edition statement</cite>  
>>(*Comment*: Statement of responsibility applies to all editions)

#### 2C3. Phrases about notes, appendixes, etc.

<a name="2C3.1">2C3.1</a> If there are phrases about notes, appendixes, and such supplementary
matter and they apply to the edition in hand but not necessarily to all editions of
the work, transcribe them as statements of responsibility relating to the edition
only in the case when the phrase names or otherwise identifies a person or
corporate body and appears in the same source as the edition statement.

><cite>The fourth edition / with a new epilogue by the author</cite>
 
><cite>Editio altera, ab innumeris erroribus emendata / huic editioni accessere Jacobi Bongarsii excerptiones chronologicae ad Justini historias accommodatae</cite> 

<a name="2C3.2">2C3.2</a> If the phrase does not name a person or corporate body, transcribe it as

the statement of responsibility after all the edition statements.

<a name="2C4.2">2C4.2</a> If the publication has parallel edition statements (see 2B9 xxlinkxx) and statements
of responsibility relating to the edition in more than one language or script,
transcribe each statement of responsibility after the edition statement to which it

transposed statements of responsibility.

### 2D. Statement relating to a named revision of an edition

<a name="4A2.1">4A2.1</a>. The prescribed sources of information for the publication, distribution,
etc., area are the title page, colophon, other preliminaries, and dust jacket (see
introductory section IX.2 xxlinkxx), in that order of preference. If the information for an
element is not present in these sources, any source may be used to supply
needed information (see 0G6 xxlinkxx). If statements belonging to different elements are
found in separate sources, combine them to make a complete statement in the
publication, distribution, etc., area. However, do not combine statements
belonging to a single element when they appear in different sources within the
publication.

<a name="4A2.2">4A2.2</a>. If any part of the publication, distribution, etc., area is taken from a source
other than the title page, make a note to indicate the source (see 7B8 xxlinkxx). Make a

<a name="4A3.2">4A3.2</a>. If statements belonging to different elements appear out of order, or as
part of another area, and they are grammatically separable, transpose them as
needed. Make a note indicating the original position of the transposed elements.

<a name="4A3.3">4A3.3</a> If the elements are not grammatically separable, or their transposition
would result in an ambiguous or otherwise confusing construction, transcribe
them in the order found and supply missing elements in square brackets as
needed (see 0G6 xxlinkxx).

#### 4A4. Fictitious or incorrect information  

If all information relating to the publication, distribution, etc., area appearing in
the publication is known to be fictitious or incorrect, transcribe it nonetheless and
make an explanatory note. If the actual details are known, or can be reasonably
surmised, supply them at the end of the area as a correction in square brackets.
Include the source of this information in the note. If some but not all of the
information is known to be fictitious or incorrect, apply the appropriate rule (see
4B9, 4C5, 4D2.4 xxlinkxx).

#### 4A5. Information covered by labels, etc.

If any of the original details relating to the publication, distribution, etc., area are
covered by a label or other means showing later information, transcribe the later
information. If the original details are visible or otherwise available, transcribe or
give them in a note.

#### 4A6. Elements relating to publication, distribution, etc., vs. elements relating to manufacture

Consider the wording, layout, and typography of the publication itself when
determining the most appropriate place to transcribe information relating to the
publication, distribution, etc., area. Keep in mind that statements relating to
printing will sometimes be more appropriately transcribed as elements of
publication, distribution, etc., and sometimes as elements of manufacture.<sup>13</sup> Consult the following instructions for guidance.

<small><sup>13</sup> The roles of publishers, printers, and booksellers were not clearly delimited in the handpress
period. Statements relating to printing frequently appear prominently on early printed
materials, reflecting the tendency of printers to function as more than solely manufacturers. As
the book trade industry became increasingly specialized over time, however, the role of the
publisher gradually assumed greater importance, while the roles of manufacturer and distributor
came to be subordinate.</small>

##### 4A6.1. Statements relating to publication, distribution, etc., only

If the publication bears only a statement relating to publication, distribution, etc.,
or multiple such statements, transcribe the statement(s) according to the
instructions in 4B, 4C, and 4D xxlinkxx.

##### 4A6.2. Statements relating to manufacture only

<a name="4A6.2.1">4A6.2.1</a> If the publication bears only a statement relating to manufacture, or
multiple such statements, generally assume the manufacturer(s) to also be
functioning as publisher(s), distributor(s), etc. Transcribe the statement(s)
according to the instructions in 4B, 4C, and 4D xxlinkxx. Consider the words "place of
publication" and "publisher" in those instructions to refer equally to the place of
manufacture and name of manufacturer in such cases.

and to manufacture, determine whether or not the statements are grammatically
separable.

<a name="4A6.3.1">4A6.3.1</a> If the statements are grammatically inseparable, transcribe them
according to the instructions in 4B, 4C, and 4D xxlinkxx. Consider the words "place of

<a name="4B6.2">4B6.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the places are too numerous to list
exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of
identification, the place of publication, distribution, etc., statement may be
shortened by omitting all the places after the third. In such cases, use the mark of
omission and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and
script of the cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the
number of omitted places (if more than one) in the supplied phrase.

<a name="4C6.2">4C6.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the names are too numerous to list
exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant loss of
identification, the publisher, distributor, etc., statement may be shortened by
omitting all the names after the third. In such cases, use the mark of omission
and supply after it in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the
cataloging agency to convey the extent of the omission. Include the number of
omitted publishers (or firms) and the number of omitted places (if more than
one) in the supplied phrase.

#### 4C7. Names of publishers, distributors, etc., in multipart monographs

If the publication is issued in more than one physical part and the name or form
of name of the publisher, distributor, etc., changes in the course of publication,
transcribe the publisher, distributor, etc., statement of the first or earliest part
and give the publisher, distributor, etc., statement of the later part(s) in a note.

#### 4C8. Supplied and conjectured names of publishers, distributors, etc.

If no name, address, or device of a publisher, distributor, etc., appears in the
publication, supply the name of the publisher, distributor, etc., in square brackets
if known. If the responsibility of a publisher, distributor, etc., for a particular
publication is conjectured, either add a question mark to any supplied name or
give the information in a note. In any case of a supplied publisher, distributor,
etc., give supporting evidence in a note.

#### 4C9. No supplied name of publisher, distributor, etc.

If no publisher, distributor, etc., statement can be supplied, use the abbreviation
"s.n." (sine nomine) in square brackets.

#### 4C10. Publisher, distributor, etc., transcribed as part of another area

If no publisher, distributor, etc., statement appears in the publication, but the
name of the publisher, distributor, etc., has already been transcribed as part of
another area, supply it in a short identifiable form within square brackets.

If transcribing a publisher, distributor, etc., statement in the publication,
distribution, etc., area, however, do not abridge or expand the statement simply
because it repeats or omits information given elsewhere in the description.

#### 4C11. Publisher, distributor, etc., statements in more than one language or script

<a name="4C11.1">4C11.1</a> If the name of the publisher, distributor, etc., appears in more than one
language or script, transcribe the statement in the language or script of the title
proper, or if this criterion does not apply, transcribe the statement that appears
first. Transcribe the remaining statement(s) as parallel statements, preceding
each by an equals sign. Make a note to indicate the original position on the
source of any transposed statements.

<a name="4C11.2">4C11.2</a> *Optionally*, if it is considered that the parallel statements are too
numerous to list exhaustively, and that some may be omitted without significant
loss of identification, omit parallel statements after the first using the mark of
omission. Transcribe the omitted statement(s) in a note, if considered important.

### 4D. Date of publication, distribution, etc.

#### 4D1. General rule

<a name="4D1.1">4D1.1</a> Transcribe dates of publication, distribution, etc., as part of this element.
Transcribe dates of printing or other manufacture only if appropriate according
to the instructions in 4A6 xxlinkxx (i.e., when the wording, layout, or typography of the

this element. If both the place and the date of printing appear in conjunction with
the phrase "printed in the year," determine whether "printed" is to be
transcribed with the place or the date according to the punctuation or
typography of the source.

part of another element or area according to one or more of the conditions
enumerated in 1B1.1 xxlinkxx, transcribe it within that area or element and supply the
date in square brackets as the date of publication, distribution, etc.

#### 4D2. Transcription involving adjustments or additions

<a name="4D2.1">4D2.1</a> **Roman numerals**. If the date appears in roman numerals, transcribe the
date as it appears. Omit internal spaces and punctuation (see 0G3.4, 0G4.1 xxlink).

substitute for it the date in arabic numerals in square brackets. If the supplied
date includes a day/month, use the sequence: day, month, year. Make a note
explaining the source of the date. Include a transcription of the original
chronogram in the note, if considered important.

If a date from the title page has been transcribed as the publication, distribution,
etc., date, and evidence for a later date of publication, distribution, etc., appears
in a source other than the title page, supply the later date in square brackets as a
correction. If necessary, make a note to clarify that the date added as a correction
is a differing date of publication, not a correction of an error on the title page.

4D2.5. Julian/Old Style dates. If the year of publication, distribution, etc., is
based on the Julian calendar (sometimes called the Old Style calendar) and the
publication is known to have been published in the following year according to
the Gregorian calendar, transcribe the date as it appears and supply the
Gregorian year in square brackets.<sup>14</sup> Make a note to indicate the basis for the
supplied year. Do not amend the month and day, if present, by supplying
Gregorian equivalents. In case of doubt, do not adjust the year.

<small><sup>14</sup> The Julian calendar was gradually abandoned in favor of the Gregorian calendar beginning
in 1582, with different countries adopting the calendar in different years. The difficulty in
determining dates during this period is further complicated by the fact that January 1 was not
universally used to reckon the start of a new year (e.g., before adopting the Gregorian calendar, Great Britain and its colonies long calculated the turn of the year on March 25, the Feast of the
Annunciation or "Lady Day"). For assistance in establishing Gregorian dates, consult a reference
source such as Adriano Cappelli’s *Cronologia e Calendario Perpetuo* or C.R. Cheneyʹs *Handbook of
Dates for Students of English History*.</small>

#### 4D6. Copyright dates and dates of deposit

<a name="4D6.1">4D6.1</a> Do not transcribe a copyright date or a date of deposit in the publication,
distribution, etc., area.

<a name="4D6.2">4D6.2</a> If a date of publication, distribution, etc., does not appear in the source
and it is likely that the date of copyright or deposit represents the date of
publication, supply the date in square brackets as the date of publication. Include
a question mark if the supplied date is conjectural. Make a note to indicate that
the basis for the supplied date is the date of copyright or deposit. Include in the
note as much information as is deemed important to the cataloging agency. If
transcribing a copyright symbol in the note, use a lowercase c to represent the
symbol if it cannot be reproduced using available typographic facilities.

#### 4D8. Date of publication, distribution, etc., on part pages

If parts of a publication have individual title pages bearing dates that differ from
the date pertaining to the whole publication, give these additional dates in a
note. If, however, one of these dates is a more accurate reflection of the actual
date of publication, distribution, etc., than the date pertaining to the whole
publication, give it as a correction as instructed in 4D2.4 xxlinkxx.

### 4E. Place of manufacture

#### 4E1. General rule

Transcribe names of places associated with printers and other manufacturers as
part of this element when appropriate according to the instructions in 4A6 xxlinkxx.

If the place of manufacture does not appear, or is transcribed as part of another
area or element, supply the place of manufacture in square brackets. Use a
modern English form of the name, if there is one, and include the name of the
larger jurisdiction if considered necessary for identification. Provide a

### 4G. Date of manufacture

Transcribe a date of impression or other manufacture as part of this element only
if it has not been treated as the date of publication, distribution, etc., following
the instructions in 4A6 xxlinkxx, and only if it applies, or is likely to apply, to all copies of
the edition or issue being cataloged. Such situations will occur only rarely. Dates
of impression or other manufacture associated with a substantially unchanged
impression of an edition or issue may be transcribed in a local note, if considered
important.

><cite>, 1989</cite>  
>Optional local note: <cite>Library's copy: "1990 printing"--T.p. verso</cite>

**Alternative rule**: If a decision has been made to create a separate bibliographic
description for an individual impression, state, binding variant, or copy within a
single edition or issue (see introductory section X.1.4 and Appendix E xxlinkxx), transcribe a
date of impression or other manufacture associated with a substantially unchanged
impression as part of the date of manufacture element. Transcribe the date as it
appears, together with any associated words or phrases.

itself.
5B1.2. Record the complete number of leaves, pages, or columns in accordance
with the terminology suggested by the volume (or other physical unit) itself.
Describe a volume with leaves numbered on both sides, or with leaves
unnumbered and printed on both sides, in terms of pages. Describe a volume
with leaves numbered on one side only, or with leaves unnumbered and printed
on one side only, in terms of leaves. If the leaves of a volume are numbered and
printed on one side only, state this fact in a note. Describe in terms of columns a
volume so numbered when it is printed with more than one column to the page.
If a publication contains sequences in more than one kind of numbering, record
each sequence in its appropriate term as pages, leaves, or columns.
5B1.3. Recording the "complete number" as stated above means recording the
number on the last numbered page or leaf of each numbered sequence as the
basic statement of extent, with any necessary additions according to succeeding
rules, e.g., 5B3, for the addition of unnumbered pages or leaves. Record arabic
and roman numerals as they appear in the publication. Record roman numerals
uppercase or lowercase as they appear. If the pages or leaves are lettered rather
than numbered, record the first and last letters followed by the word or
abbreviation indicating pages or leaves. Use arabic numerals to designate pages,
etc., that are numbered in words or in characters other than arabic or roman and
make an explanatory note.

describe the rest of the publication or the part of the publication with which they
are associated. In ambiguous cases count them as leaves when they are all
printed on one side only; otherwise count them as pages. Use arabic numerals
within square brackets. If the gatherings are discernible, include in the count
blank leaves at the beginning of the first gathering or at the end of the final
gathering when they are present in a copy in hand or known to be present in
other copies. Do not count possibly blank leaves wanting according to signature

5B6.6. If a publication contains more than three sequences of numbered or more
than five sequences of numbered and unnumbered pages or leaves, preferably
record all of the sequences. If it is not practical to record all the sequences (e.g., if
they are exceedingly numerous), then employ one of the following methods:
a) Record the total number of pages or leaves followed by "in various
pagings" or "in various foliations."

6C. Parallel titles of series
6C1. If the source bears a series title in more than one language or script,
transcribe as the series title proper the title that is in the language or script of the
title proper. If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the title that appears first
in the source. Transcribe the remaining title(s), together with any associated
information, as parallel series titles. Precede each parallel series title by an equals
sign. Make a note to indicate the original position on the source of any

7. NOTE AREA
Contents:
7A. Preliminary rule
7B. Notes
7A. Preliminary rule
7A1. General instructions
7A1.1. Notes qualify and amplify the formal description, and are especially
important for recording types of information not accounted for in other areas of
the description. Notes can therefore deal with any aspect of the publication.
7A1.2. Notes, by their nature, cannot be enumerated exhaustively, but can be
categorized in terms of the areas of description to which they pertain. In addition
to notes relating to these areas, there are notes that do not correspond to any area
of the formalized areas of description. Occasionally it may be useful to group
together notes that refer to more than one area, for instance, when they are all
based on one source within the work, such as a privilege statement.
7A1.3. If the description in the areas preceding the note area does not clearly
identify the resource being cataloged, make whatever notes are necessary for
unambiguous identification. When appropriate, refer to detailed descriptions in
standard catalogs or bibliographies. Provide sufficient information to identify the
specific source, whether using a general note, a formal "References" note giving
the source in prescribed form (see 7B14), or some combination of the two.
7A1.4. Notes may also be made to justify added entries intended for special
indexes of personal or corporate names, titles, genres/forms, physical
characteristics, provenance, etc. Whenever possible, use terms taken from lists of
controlled vocabularies when making such notes and added entries. Prefer the
terminology used in controlled vocabularies issued by the RBMS Bibliographic
Standards Committee. Terms from other authorized vocabularies (e.g., the Art &
Architecture Thesaurus Online) may also be used as appropriate.
AREA 7. NOTE
Descriptive 128 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
7A1.5. In general, notes are not required, but some notes are required in
particular situations and are so indicated in previous rules, e.g., 1E3, 2A2, or 4A4,
and in some of the rules for this area.18
7A2. Punctuation
Start a new paragraph for each note. End each paragraph with a period or other
mark of final punctuation.
Separate introductory wording from the main content of a note by a colon
followed but not preceded by a space.
7A3. Sources of information
Take information recorded in notes from any suitable source. Square brackets are
required only for interpolations within quoted material.
7A4. Form of notes
7A4.1. Order of information. If information in a note corresponds to information
found in the title and statement of responsibility, edition, publication,
distribution, etc., physical description, or series areas, usually give the elements
of information in the order in which they appear in those areas. In such cases, use
prescribed punctuation, except substitute a period for a period‐space‐dash‐space.
Revision of: 3rd ed. London : Macmillan, 1953
7A4.2. Quotations. Record quotations from the publication or from other sources
in quotation marks. Follow the quotation by an indication of its source, unless
that source is the title page. Do not use prescribed punctuation within
quotations.

the Gospel in Foreign Parts"

AREA 7. NOTE
Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) 129
7A4.3. Formal notes. Use formal notes employing an invariable introductory
word or phrase or a standard verbal formula when uniformity of presentation
assists in the recognition of the type of information being presented or when
their use provides economy of space without loss of clarity.
7A4.4. Informal notes. When making informal notes, use statements that present
the information as briefly as clarity, understandability, and good grammar
permit.
7A5. Notes citing other editions and works
7A5.1. Other editions. In citing another edition of the same work, give enough
information to identify the edition cited.
Revision of: 2nd ed., 1869
7A5.2. Other works and other manifestations of the same work. In citing other
works and other manifestations of the same work (other than different editions
with the same title), give whatever information is appropriate, such as the main
entry heading, title proper (or uniform title), statement of responsibility, edition
statement, or date of publication. Arrange the information provided in the form
that makes most sense in the particular case. Abridge the information as needed
without using the mark of omission.

7B. Notes
Some of the most common types of notes are listed below; other notes than those
provided for may be made, if considered important. Specific applications of
many of these notes are provided in the preceding sections. Make notes as called
for in the following subrules, and, generally, in the order in which they are listed
here. If a particular note is of primary importance, it may be given first,
regardless of its order in this list. When appropriate, combine two or more notes
to make one note.

provide signatures when a volume has no pagination or foliation.
7B9.2. Unavailable characters. If the gatherings are signed with a mark of
contraction (see 0G8.2, Appendix G3) that cannot be reproduced using available
typographical facilities, substitute the spelled out form and enclose it in square

these will give the impression that the leaves have actually been signed with
Greek letters (see 7B9.9).

signing of the volume does not match its actual gatherings, indicate this in the
note.

7B9.6. Concurrent signatures. If the volume is signed using two concurrent
sequences, provide both sets of signatures in the note. Give the signatures that
correspond to the actual gatherings first, if this can be determined.

characters using arabic numeration. Include an indication of the script used in
the signatures in the note.

If the nonroman characters are accompanied by parallel numeration using
another script, note this as well.
Signatures (in parallel Hebrew and arabic numerals): pi8 1-48

followed by gatherings signed 1‐4 in both Hebrew characters and arabic
numerals)
In case of doubt as to whether a sequence is numeric or alphabetic, assume a
numeric sequence.
Signatures (in Hebrew characters): 2-38
(Comment: Indicates two gatherings signed with characters that could belong to
either an alphabetic or numeric sequence)
7B9.8. Nonroman signatures (alphabetic sequence). If the gatherings are signed
with nonroman characters that follow an alphabetic sequence, transcribe in
original script if typographical facilities permit, or in romanized form using the
ALA‐LC Romanization Tables. Use uppercase or lowercase characters according to
the usage of the piece. If the script is one that does not employ case, or if the case
of the characters cannot be determined, use lowercase characters. Include an
indication of the script used in the signatures if recording them in romanized
form, or if the signature statement would otherwise be ambiguous.
7B9.9. Greek alphabetic signatures. For gatherings signed in Greek alphabetic
sequences, use the 24‐letter alphabet in the following chart as the basis for
compressed signature statements (Greek letters are given in the top row, their
romanized equivalents in the bottom row):

7B9.11. Other nonroman alphabetic signatures. For all other nonroman
alphabetic signature sequences, do not assume that a standard signing pattern
can be used as the basis for compressed signature statements. Give the first and
last characters in each sequence, followed by a total count of the gatherings in
that sequence in square brackets.

7B18.1. If the description corresponds to part of a publication that is made up of
two or more separately titled parts that are also separately paginated or foliated
and have separate signatures, but which have been issued together, make a note
beginning "With" followed by a colon. List the other parts of the publication in
the note, in the order in which they are found. In the case of bound volumes, list
all the other parts on the record for the first part and, in general, only the first on
the records for the subsequent parts. (Do not make such "With" notes when the
pagination, foliation, or signatures of separately titled parts are continuous with
the part being described. Instead, record these titles in a contents note as
instructed in 7B16.)
7B18.2. For each work listed, give only the elements listed below:
a) the heading; normally give this element first, usually in catalog‐entry form
(e.g., with inversion of personal names under surname, but not necessarily
including personal birth/death dates, corporate qualifiers, etc.)
b) the title proper as found in the record for the work; long titles may be
shortened (whenever the uniform title is considered useful for the identification
of the work, record it within square brackets preceding the title proper)
c) the primary statement of responsibility as found in the title and statement
of responsibility area of the record for the work, unless it is redundant of the
heading or exceedingly lengthy

7B19. Copy being described and library holdings (Local notes)
7B19.1. General rule
7B19.1.1. Make local notes on any special features or imperfections of the copy
being described when they are considered important. Copy‐specific information
is highly desirable in the context of rare materials cataloging, which puts greater
emphasis on materials as artifacts than is usual in general cataloging practice.
Local notes can also provide warrant for added entries (e.g., added entries for the
names of former owners or binders, for various kinds of provenance evidence,
binding characteristics, etc.). Carefully distinguish local notes from other kinds of
notes that record information valid for all copies of the bibliographic unit being
cataloged.
For many older publications, however, it will not be readily ascertainable
whether the characteristics of a single copy are in fact shared by other copies. In
case of doubt, consider that the characteristics of the copy in hand are not shared
by other copies.
7B19.1.2. The extent and depth of detail provided in local notes will be
determined by the local policies of the cataloging agency. The rules set forth in
this area are intended primarily to provide guidance and examples; the
instructions are not to be seen as prescriptive.
7B19.1.3. Features that may be brought out here include known imperfections
and anomalies, the presence of advertisements not recorded in area 5 (see 5B5),
illumination, rubrication, and other hand coloring (unless issued that way by the
publisher; see 7B10.5), provenance evidence (such as bookplates, stamps,
autographs, and manuscript annotations), the names of persons or institutions
associated with specific copies, copy‐specific binding details and the names of
binders, copy numbers (see 7B7.5), and "Bound with" notes.
7B19.1.4. Include in local notes one or more of the following identifiers, if
considered important: a designation of the holding institution (e.g., a library’s
name, acronym, or code), a designation of the item’s physical location (e.g., a
shelfmark), or an indication of the item’s copy number (if the institution holds
more than one copy). Such identifiers are especially recommended if the
bibliographic record is to be contributed to a union catalog or other shared
database.

APPENDIX A. MARC 21 DESCRIPTIVE CONVENTIONS CODE
A1. Introduction
In MARC 21 bibliographic records, a code may be used in field 040, subfield ‡e,
to indicate when specific cataloging conventions have been followed in addition to
the conventions identified in the descriptive cataloging form (Leader/18). This
appendix offers guidance in using "dcrmb," the code designating DCRM(B), in
040 subfield ‡e.
A2. Full‐level DCRM(B)
Apply the code "dcrmb" to records for resources cataloged at full level (i.e., the
normative application of these rules). The fact that such records follow the fulllevel
provisions of DCRM(B) is indicated by the blank value assigned in the
encoding level (Leader/17) and the code "dcrmb" in 040 subfield ‡e.
A3. Collection‐level DCRM(B)
Do not apply the code "dcrmb" to records for resources cataloged according to
the collection‐level guidelines found in Appendix B. The fact that such records
contain collection‐level descriptions is indicated by the value c assigned in the
bibliographic level (Leader/07). The guidelines in Appendix B suggest factors to
consider in constructing collection‐level records for rare materials and provide
examples useful in a special collections context. However, the conventions
conform substantially to those governing standard collection‐level descriptions,
as presented in Cataloging Service Bulletin, no. 78 (Fall 1997).
A4. Core‐level DCRM(B)
Apply the code "dcrmb" to records for resources cataloged according to the corelevel
guidelines found in Appendix C. The fact that such records follow the corelevel
provisions of DCRM(B) is indicated by the value 4 assigned in the encoding
level (Leader/17) and the code "dcrmb" in 040 subfield ‡e.
A5. Minimal‐level DCRM(B)
Apply the code "dcrmb" to records for resources cataloged according to the
minimal‐level guidelines found in Appendix D. The fact that such records follow
APPENDIX A. MARC 21 DESCRIPTIVE CONVENTIONS CODE
Descriptive 152 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
the minimal‐level provisions of DCRM(B) is indicated by the value 7 assigned in
the encoding level (Leader/17) and the code "dcrmb" in 040 subfield ‡e.
A6. Microforms and digital reproductions of books
Apply the code "dcrmb" to records for microforms and digital reproductions of
books if the descriptive portion of the record conforms to DCRM(B) (full, core, or
minimal level). If, however, DCRM(B) (full, core, or minimal level) is not used in
all aspects (e.g., if the size of the book is not recorded in the physical description
area), do not use the code "dcrmb."
A7. Nonbook formats
Do not apply the code "dcrmb" to records for nonbook materials such as serials,
maps, music, and graphics, even though they may have been cataloged
according to an adapted, "DCRM(B)‐like" standard.20 Do, however, apply the
code ʺdcrmbʺ to individual and special issues of serials cataloged separately as
monographs according to the provisions of Appendix H.
A8. "Special collections cataloging"
In this context "special collections cataloging" means fuller use of notes, access
points, and other elements that are not specifically called for in AACR2 or its
predecessors, but that follow the spirit of DCRM(B) without following its rules
completely. Such cataloging is frequently done for 19th‐century and later
materials housed in special collections. Do not apply the code "dcrmb" to records
for "special collections cataloging" unless the cataloging follows the descriptive
requirements of DCRM(B) completely (full, core, or minimal level).
A9. Earlier codes
If an existing record contains an earlier code in 040 subfield ‡e, such as "dcrb"
(Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books) or "bdrb" (Bibliographic Description of Rare
Books), and the description is being updated to DCRM(B) standards, delete the
earlier code and add the "dcrmb" code to the end of the 040 field in subfield ‡e.
20 Use a DCRM component manual for the format being described if one exists.

APPENDIX B. COLLECTION‐LEVEL RECORDS
B1. Introduction
B1.1. This appendix offers guidance in the creation of bibliographic records for
collections of printed items that will receive collection‐level treatment based on
administrative or curatorial decisions. Several rationales can be cited to justify a
decision to use collection‐level cataloging:
 It can be a means of highlighting the shared characteristics of a collection of
materials by providing a summary‐level description, thereby "adding value"
to any other forms of intellectual access, such as item‐level records, and
revealing collection strengths that may not otherwise be obvious.
 It can be a means of providing temporary control of unprocessed collections.
 It can be a cost‐effective means of providing bibliographic control for lowpriority
items. Although this might seem to promise a solution to the
problem of an institution’s limited means, it should be understood that
adequately arranging and processing collections prior to cataloging also
takes time. Since there are significant costs associated with under‐cataloged
materials, this rationale should be used with careful consideration.
B1.2. A collection‐level record may serve as the sole method of access for the
collection, with contents information provided in notes. Some or all of the
collection may also be represented by item‐level bibliographic records, which
may be created at any level of fullness using cataloging rules such as AACR2 or
components of DCRM. Item‐level access may also be provided for some or all of
the collection through inventories, finding aids, or databases (referred to
hereafter as "finding aids"), which may be linked to collection‐level records.
Providing some form of item‐level access to resources represented by a
collection‐level record offers significant benefits for users and reduces the risk of
redundant acquisition of those resources. Decisions about the appropriate type
and level of description should be made based on institutional goals, priorities,
and resources, as well as the attributes of the collections themselves.
B1.3. The following guidelines are based on those issued by the Library of
Congress for collection‐level cataloging published in Cataloging Service Bulletin,
no. 78 (Fall 1997). Examples have been added, drawn from the types of
collections likely to be found in rare books and special collections libraries.
Catalogers creating collection‐level records will also need to consult the
APPENDIX B. COLLECTION‐LEVEL RECORDS
Descriptive 154 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
appropriate cataloging rules, MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data, and their
local system documentation in order to create useful, descriptive, and complete
records using the various fields available to describe collections, as well as to
create additional access points. Catalogers wishing to contribute collection‐level
records as part of the Program for Cooperative Cataloging will need to consult
the relevant instructions in BIBCO Core Record Standards.
B1.4. These guidelines are not intended for description of traditional archival or
manuscript collections. Rules for cataloging such collections are addressed in
specialized sets of rules such as Describing Archives: A Content Standard. However,
many of the activities associated with arranging and describing traditional
archival or manuscript collections also pertain to collections of printed materials
and inform these guidelines.
B2. Selection of materials
B2.1. Collections normally fall into one of three categories:
 groups of items that come to a library already well organized by a previous
owner
 groups of items that come from a single source, but with minimal or no
previous organization
 groups of items that are assembled into collections by the library for the
purpose of processing and storage, and are therefore termed "intentionally
assembled collections" (previously called "artificial collections")
B2.2. All three types of collections tend to be organized around one or more
unifying factors, which may include:
 personal author
 issuing body
 genre/form
 subject
 language or nationality
 provenance
 time period
APPENDIX B. COLLECTION‐LEVEL RECORDS
Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) 155
B2.3. Types of materials appropriate to consider for collection‐level treatment
include:
 groups of materials that share one or more of the above factors, and for
which access can adequately be provided with a single classification number
and/or a collective set of access points
 groups of pamphlets or ephemera in various formats that are judged not to
merit item‐level cataloging, but that collectively are of research value
B3. Arrangement and description
B3.1. Arrangement and description are terms used to describe various types of
processing activities that bring order and control to collections of materials. They
commonly involve the physical handling, sorting, and listing of materials, as well
as preservation and housing activities. Additional guidance in these matters may
be found in Kathleen Roeʹs Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts.
B3.2. Arrangement. Arrangement is the process of sorting individual items into
meaningful groups and placing those groups into useful relationships with each
other. Materials can be arranged in many logical ways, and the design of the
arrangement should be determined by examining the material to consider the
types of access most likely to serve the needs of researchers and other potential
users. Different collections will require differing levels and methods of
arrangement. For these reasons, decisions about arrangement must be made
individually for each collection.
B3.2.1. Organized prior to acquisition. For collections that come to the library
already well organized, every effort should be made to maintain this order.
Maintaining the original order of a collection can reveal significant information
about the previous owner’s use of the materials and is, for this reason, a basic
tenet of archival practice.
B3.2.2. Organized by the library. Collections that come to the library lacking any
recognizable order must be examined, sorted, and arranged in some fashion
prior to cataloging. Collections consisting of many items are normally divided
into hierarchical subgroupings. Customary types of arrangement include:
 by source or provenance
 by genre/form
APPENDIX B. COLLECTION‐LEVEL RECORDS
Descriptive 156 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
 by content or topic
 in chronological order
 in alphabetical order (by author, title, etc.)
B3.2.3. Acquired individually. Materials originally acquired as individual items
(whether simultaneously or over time) may be grouped in intentionally
assembled collections, as noted above. Appropriate library staff, which may
include curators and catalogers, must determine which materials will be so
combined, how they will be arranged, and at what level of fullness they will be
described (e.g., whether the material will receive contents notes and/or authortitle
analytics, whether it will be classified and shelved with book collections or
boxed and treated archivally, etc.).
B3.3 Description. Description is the process of recording the information that
was gathered during the sorting and arranging stages. For large collections,
finding aids typically are compiled to provide a greater level of detail. Finding
aids vary widely in format, style, and complexity. They generally consist of two
parts. The first is a narrative introduction that includes: biographical sketches or
historical contextual information; a content summary highlighting strengths,
gaps, weaknesses, and characterizing the collection’s extent and depth; and
information concerning the collection’s administration and use, such as
restrictions on access. The second part is a listing of the items or groups of items
that comprise the collection. For collections arranged hierarchically, the listings
may stop at a collective subgroup level or may extend down to the file or item
level.
B4. Elements of the bibliographic record
The rules that guide the bibliographic description and added entry portions of
collection‐level cataloging are the latest edition of AACR2, supplemented by use
of appropriate national rule interpretations. Use the rules in conjunction with
these guidelines, which are arranged by MARC 21 field. Fields for which no
specific collection‐level instructions are required are not included here but may
be used as appropriate.

The main entry heading is determined by application of the appropriate
cataloging rules. Title main entry is appropriate for many collections (see AACR2
rule 21.7). A 1XX name main entry is appropriate when all materials have the
same personal author(s) or emanate from a single corporate body (AACR2 rule
21.4), including collections of laws with main entry under jurisdiction (AACR2
rule 21.31B1).

Summary notes are narrative, free‐text statements of the scope and contents of
collections. Details may include forms of materials, dates of subject coverage, and
the most significant topics, persons, places, or events. A summary note may be
used in lieu of or in addition to a 505 note. If the collection contents are listed in a
separate finding aid, use only a 520 note and also make a 555 finding aid note.

Formatted contents notes provide a structured method of recording item‐level
information. Elements may include author, title, edition, date of creation or
publication, extent, scale, etc. Assign a number to each item, record it within
square brackets in the 505 note, and write it on each item. For materials that lack
routine bibliographic indicia, or for large collections of many items, prefer the
narrative 520 summary note to the 505 note.

B5. Additional considerations
B5.1. Lengthy descriptions divided into more than one record. It may be
desirable to divide the description of a collection into more than one
bibliographic record due to factors such as complexity or length of the
description or system limitations on record length. The description may be
divided in whatever way is most sensible. For example, the collection may be
organized in logical groupings, each of which can be represented in a single
record (e.g., pamphlets concerning tobacco consumption, pamphlets encouraging
smoking, and pamphlets discouraging smoking). Alternatively, a new record
may be started at a logical breaking point, such as with every twentieth item,
based on chronology, etc.
When multiple bibliographic records are created for one collection, most data
elements will be the same across all records, according to the guidelines
discussed above, with the following exceptions:
245 field: Title statement. Indicate in subfield ‡n or in subfield ‡p, as
appropriate, which part of the collection is being represented in the
record.
260 field: Publication, distribution, etc. (Imprint). If the collection is
divided based on chronology, include the appropriate range of dates in
each record.
APPENDIX B. COLLECTION‐LEVEL RECORDS
Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) 165
300 field: Physical description. Indicate in the extent statement in the
subfield ‡a of each record the number of items represented in the record
out of the total number of items in the collection, using terminology
appropriate to the material being described.
300 ‡a Items 1-40 of 80 in 1 bound volume
300 ‡a Items 41-80 of 80 in 1 bound volume
5XX fields: Notes. With the exception of the 505 contents note (see below),
give the same 5XX fields in each record. In addition, make a note in each
record indicating that the collection being cataloged is represented by
more than one record, and provide references to the other records.
505 field: Contents note. List in a 505 note only those items described in
the particular record. Numbering within contents notes should be
consecutive from one record to another.
B5.2. Considerations when adding to collections. Sometimes items are added to
collections after initial processing or cataloging has been completed. In such
cases, edit or add to the description as necessary, paying particular attention to
the following elements:
 Dates (260 field and fixed fields)
 Extent (300 field)
 Contents (505 and/or 520 field)
 Subject and genre/form headings (6XX fields)
 Added entries (7XX fields)

APPENDIX C. CORE‐LEVEL RECORDS
C1. Introduction
The elements of description provided in DCRM(B) constitute a full set of
information for describing rare materials. This appendix sets out a less‐than‐full
level of description containing those elements required by the Program for
Cooperative Cataloging (PCC) in its standard for core‐level records for rare
materials. The core record standard was defined by the PCC for use within the
context of its national cataloging program, BIBCO, to support the goal of
providing cost‐effective cataloging that meets commonly accepted standards.
Although the core record standard originated with the BIBCO program, it can be
used by any library, BIBCO participant or not. Headings on all DCRM(B) corelevel
records contributed to BIBCO must be supported by authority records in
the LC/NACO and LC/SACO Authority Files, with the exception of certain series
headings. Authority records are not required for headings on other DCRM(B)
core‐level records.
C2. Application
Catalogers may apply the core‐level standard to any rare materials described
using DCRM(B), with one exception: it is not to be applied to books printed
before 1501 (incunabula). DCRM(B) core‐level records are especially appropriate
when faithful and accurate descriptions are desirable, and the provision of
subject and other access points is important, but abridged transcriptions and
fewer notes are acceptable.
For rare books, the commitment, on the cataloger’s part, is to render
bibliographic details of the book as accurately as possible insofar as they are
presented by the specimen in hand; also, to ensure that they are scrupulously
stated, according to the provisions of DCRM(B). The strength of DCRM(B) is that
it provides for "expanded coverage" of books deserving such treatment;
conversely, it is possible to use those provisions for expansion as guidelines for
trimming the description. By omitting most notes and taking the options given in
DCRM(B) for abbreviating descriptive areas, or by not taking the options to
expand the same areas, an effective DCRM(B) core‐level record can be created.
APPENDIX C. CORE‐LEVEL RECORDS
Descriptive 168 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
C3. Elements of the bibliographic record
Use the guidelines set forth below, taken from the BIBCO Core Record
Standards, to create core‐level records using DCRM(B).
Leader and directory
Depending on the individual automated system or bibliographic utility, part or
all of the leader and directory may be system‐supplied. Generally speaking, the
cataloger will have to supply values for the following leader positions:
06 Type of record
07 Bibliographic level
17 Encoding level
18 Descriptive cataloging form
Give the encoding level (Leader/17) a value of 4 to indicate a core‐level record.
Control fields: 001, 003, 005
These fields are generally system‐supplied.
Control field: 007
Code the following positions of the Microform 007 if appropriate:
00 Category of material
01 Specific material designation
Control field: 008
Code at least the following positions:
06 Type of date/Publication status
07‐10 Date 1
11‐14 Date 2
15‐17 Place of publication, production or execution
22 Target audience
23 Form of item

020 field: International standard book number (ISBN)
Mandatory if applicable.
040 field: Cataloging source
Bibliographic records for books that reflect the DCRM(B) core‐level standard
must contain the designation "dcrmb" in subfield ‡e of field 040.
042 field: Authentication code
For DCRM(B) core‐level records contributed by members of the PCC BIBCO
program, include the designation "pcc" in field 042. For other DCRM(B) core
records, leave the field blank.
050, 082, 086, 090, etc., fields: Call numbers
Assignment of at least one classification number from an established classification
system recognized in MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data is encouraged, but not
mandatory.
Since institutional practices for rare books often involve locally formulated call
numbers, a requirement for a national standard classification could cause additional
or undue effort for creators of DCRM(B) core‐level records. However, if an
institution supplies standard call numbers to materials covered by the DCRM(B)
core record standard, it is encouraged to add these numbers in the appropriate call
number field.
1XX field: Main entry
Mandatory if applicable. Headings on all DCRM(B) core‐level records contributed to
BIBCO must also be supported by national‐level authority records. Authority
records are not required for headings on other DCRM(B) core‐level records.

245‐4XX fields
Mandatory if applicable. One of the basic differences between AACR2 and DCRM(B)
is the method and extent to which bibliographic details (fields 245‐4XX) are
recorded. As to method, bibliographic details should be recorded as correctly as
possible, according to the descriptive conventions expected for the field. As to
extent, DCRM(B) provides some options for abridging descriptive fields, and
creators of core‐level records for rare books are encouraged to implement these
options wherever appropriate.

assign a complement of title variants that covers variations deemed important. The
variants assigned are intended to reflect cataloger judgment and/or local
institutional policy.
250 field: Edition statement
Mandatory if applicable.
260 field: Publication, distribution, etc. (Imprint)
Subfield ‡c is mandatory. Supply the data appropriate to subfields ‡a and ‡b if
readily available; otherwise, use ʺ[S.l.]ʺ and ʺ[s.n.]ʺ as appropriate. All other

4XX fields: Series statements
Mandatory if applicable. Transcribe all series as found in the publication in either a
490 or a 440 field. For DCRM(B) core‐level records being contributed to BIBCO, all
traced series must be supported by a national‐level authority record. Untraced series
need not be supported by a national‐level authority record. If a national‐level series
authority record already exists for the series, follow the first tracing practice
indicated on the record and record the series and tracing appropriately (i.e., in a 490
field, a 440 field or a 490/8XX pairing).
5XX fields: Notes
In DCRM(B) core‐level records, a note indicating the transposition of any title area
elements in the transcription is mandatory if applicable. Other notes are not required
in DCRM(B) core, except as indicated below, although they may be included, if
considered important. Notes are not required to justify added entries.

Addition of citation notes as a means of abbreviating detailed description of the
publication is encouraged. Prefer sources that provide the fullest or most
authoritative information, to keep the number of citations to a minimum.
APPENDIX C. CORE‐LEVEL RECORDS

6XX fields: Subject headings
Mandatory if applicable. Use judgment in assessing the publication and, if
appropriate, assign a complement of headings that provides access to the
primary/essential subject of the work (as opposed to secondary or tertiary aspects) at
the appropriate level of specificity. Assign such headings from an established
thesaurus or subject heading system recognized by the MARC 21 Format for
Bibliographic Data. In focusing on the primary subject, follow the conventions of the
particular subject heading system being used, including the use of paired or related
headings where necessary to represent the subject fully.
655 field: Genre/form headings
Addition of genre/form terms to the DCRM(B) core‐level record is encouraged if
local policy calls for use of such terms, as appropriate to the piece. Prefer the
terminology used in controlled vocabularies issued by the RBMS Bibliographic
Standards Committee. Terms from other authorized vocabularies (e.g., the Art &
Architecture Thesaurus Online) may also be used as appropriate.
7XX fields: Added entries
Mandatory if applicable. Use judgment in assessing each item and assign a
complement of added entries that covers the primary relationships associated with
the manifestation of which the item is a part. The inclusion and importance of added
entries are intended to reflect individual cataloger’s judgment and/or local
institutional policy.
Headings on all DCRM(B) core‐level records contributed to BIBCO must be
supported by national‐level authority records. Authority records are not required for
headings on other DCRM(B) core‐level records.

Mandatory if applicable.
Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) 173
APPENDIX D. MINIMAL‐LEVEL RECORDS
D1. Introduction
The elements of description provided in DCRM(B) constitute a full set of
information for describing rare materials. This appendix sets out a less than full
level of description containing those elements recommended as a minimum for
effective description of early printed books and other rare materials.
Libraries most often turn to minimal‐level cataloging to create accession records
for new acquisitions, to provide access to low‐priority unprocessed collections in
backlogs, and for item‐level access to digital images. These guidelines are
provided in response to such needs. Their purpose is not to promote the use of
DCRM(B) minimal‐level cataloging, but rather to provide a usable standard for
those institutions wishing to adopt it.
D2. Application
Catalogers may apply the minimal‐level standard to any rare materials described
using DCRM(B). DCRM(B) minimal‐level records are especially appropriate
when faithful and accurate descriptions are desirable, the provision of subject
and other access points is not necessarily important, and abridged transcriptions
and fewer notes are acceptable.
A minimal‐level cataloging policy is best kept simple. Complex rules for omitting
or shortening a variety of record elements would require catalogers to devote
time to learning these new rules, thereby eliminating a portion of the intended
gains in time and expense. In addition, tampering with the full description
provided by DCRM(B) areas 0‐6 and 8 would negate the very purpose of using
DCRM(B) for description of rare materials. The conclusion then is that
eliminating notes accomplishes much of the purpose of minimal‐level cataloging
because it saves considerable time while not unduly limiting access.
Bibliographic records following this approach will, in most cases, still identify
the books being described and distinguish them from similar editions or issues.
APPENDIX D. MINIMAL‐LEVEL RECORDS
Descriptive 174 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
D3. Elements of the bibliographic record
D3.1. Follow the rules in DCRM(B) areas 0‐6 and 8. Abridge the description
wherever possible as allowed by the rules. It is not necessary to make the notes
usually considered required.
D3.2. Optionally, add any additional elements in accordance with institutional
policy. In particular, consider adding one or more of the following, each of which
can significantly enhance the value of minimal‐level DCRM(B) records for
identifying rare materials:
 references to published descriptions in standard bibliographies (see 7B14),
particularly when the source cited provides more detailed information than
the minimal‐level bibliographic record
 the required notes called for in DCRM(B) (a complete list of required notes
may be found in the Index under "Required notes")
 one or more local notes describing provenance, copy numbering,
imperfections, binding, or any other information that will allow the
bibliographic record to describe the particular copy in hand with sufficient
precision to indicate the institution’s ownership of that particular copy
 optional notes based on reliable dealers’ descriptions accompanying the item
being described
D3.3. Minimal‐level cataloging policies often eliminate or simplify additional
areas of the bibliographic record such as subject headings, classification, or other
access points. This appendix does not address such questions, but users of
DCRM(B) may also wish to streamline these areas according to local needs,
taking into consideration the effect that such policies will have on special files for
printers, binders, bindings, genre/forms, provenance, and the like.
Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) 175
APPENDIX E. VARIATIONS REQUIRING A NEW RECORD
E1. Default guidelines
E1.1. This appendix addresses the issue of whether to describe bibliographic
variants using a single bibliographic record or separate records. As a default
approach, the rules contained in DCRM(B) assume that a separate bibliographic
record will be created for each bibliographic variant that represents what is
referred to as an "edition" in AACR2 and an "issue" in bibliographic scholarship.
E1.2. Following this default approach, generally consider that a new
bibliographic record is required whenever the publication distinguishes itself
from other variants by one or more of the following characteristics:
 change in content (e.g., changes in the title, statement of responsibility, or
edition statement that indicate corrections, revisions, expansions,
abridgments, or the inclusion of supplementary materials)
 different setting of type (e.g., changes in the statement of extent, a change in
bibliographic format, or differences in line‐endings and catchwords revealed
by the comparison of multiple copies)
 change in publication status (e.g., an original title page has been cancelled
and replaced; an original publication, distribution, etc., statement has been
covered with a new label; original sheets have been issued in a new
publisher’s cover bearing more recent data than that provided on the title
page, or with a new series title page)
E1.3. In general, do not consider differences relating solely to substantially
unchanged impressions, states, binding variants, or copies as an indication that a
new record is required. Examples of differences that do not in themselves
necessarily signal the need for a new record in the absence of other differences
include:
 a difference in a statement of printing (e.g., fifth printing)
 a difference in the printer or other manufacturer if the publisher has not
changed
 a difference in the printing or copyright date if the publication date has not
changed
 a difference in the publisher’s cover that does not provide evidence of a
APPENDIX E. VARIATIONS REQUIRING A NEW RECORD
Descriptive 176 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
discrete publishing unit (e.g., a change of color in publisher’s cloth)
 a difference relating to inserted publisher’s advertisements and catalogs
(unless they are integral to the publication)
 stop‐press corrections
 the presence or absence of an errata slip
 the addition, deletion, or change of an ISBN
E1.4. These basic default guidelines result in a single bibliographic record being
used to represent multiple impressions, states, and binding variants relating to a
single edition or issue. This record may include, in local notes, information that
does not apply to all copies of the edition or issue, whether the information
applies to an impression, a state, a binding variant or an individual item.
E2. Alternative guidelines
E2.1. The default approach presented above is not prescriptive and indeed may
not be desirable in every situation. Institutions may sometimes want to create
separate records for different impressions or for other bibliographic variants.
Some may want to create separate records for each individual copy.

APPENDIX F. TITLE ACCESS POINTS
F1. Introduction
Title access plays an important role in enabling users to identify and locate
special collections materials. While some title access will be handled by
controlled forms, this appendix lists specific situations, commonly encountered
by rare materials catalogers, in which the provision of uncontrolled title access
points is likely to be useful.
This appendix is not intended as an exhaustive list of all instances in which
uncontrolled title access points may be made. Use judgment in determining
which forms of access will be most useful for the item in hand. In general, do not
include access points that duplicate normalized forms of existing title access
points (e.g., the title proper, a uniform title, etc.). Take the indexing capabilities of
the institution’s local system into consideration when determining whether the
additional access points are needed.
F2. Rules relevant to the provision of title access points
The list is presented in DCRM(B) rule number order. Title access points
considered optional are labeled as such.
0B1. Title proper
Provide access for the entire title proper exactly as transcribed, disregarding
initial articles as required by filing rules.
0F1.1. Title proper in nonroman script
If nonroman text has been transcribed within the first five words of the title
proper, provide additional title access for a romanized version of the title proper
using the ALA‐LC Romanization Tables.

0G2.2. Title proper with converted letterforms I, J, i, j, u, or v
If any of the first five words in the title proper contains a letterform I, J, i, j, u, or
v that has been converted to uppercase or lowercase according to a pattern of
usage that follows pre‐modern spelling conventions, provide additional title
access for the form of the title proper that corresponds to modern orthography
(i.e., using i and u for vowels, j and v for consonants, and w for consonantal vv).
If it differs from title access points already provided, also provide title access for
the form of the title proper that corresponds to the graphical appearance of the
letters in the source, converting them from uppercase or lowercase without
regard for the pattern of usage in the publication being described.

G4. Letterforms I/J, U/V, i/j, and u/v
G4.1. Historical background. Some knowledge of the history of printing as it
applies to I/J, U/V, i/j, and u/v is helpful when applying the provisions of 0G2.2.
Until the early seventeenth century, the standard Latin alphabet contained 23
letters. The letters we know as i and j were considered different minuscule
shapes (or letterforms) of the same letter, as were the letters u and v. The letter w
was not part of the standard Latin alphabet. A printer’s choice for the u
letterform in preference to the v letterform (or the i to the j) depended on its
APPENDIX G. EARLY LETTERFORMS AND SYMBOLS
190 Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
placement in a word and was governed by convention. Conventions varied
somewhat from printer to printer, but often reflected national and regional
preferences. While there were variant letterforms for lowercase letters, in the premodern
distribution there was only one letterform for each of these letters used
as capitals: I (with the gothic form resembling a modern J), and V (with the
gothic form resembling a modern U). For example, = Iacob; =
Vnspotted (capitalized as the first word of a title).
The dominant patterns in use before the seventeenth century were:
 i used in the initial, medial, and final position, without signifying vocalic or
consonantal use; e.g., iustice (modern form: justice)
 j used in the medial or final position only after a preceding i (more typical on
the European continent), signifying vocalic use; e.g., commentarij (modern
form: commentarii)
 u used in the initial, medial or final position, without signifying vocalic or
consonantal use; e.g., oeuures (modern form: oeuvres)
 v used in the initial position, without signifying vocalic or consonantal use;
e.g., vtilita (modern form: utilita)
 I used in all positions, without signifying vocalic or consonantal use; e.g.,
Iuan (modern form: Juan)
 V used in all positions, without signifying vocalic or consonantal use; e.g.,
Vrsprung (modern form: Ursprung)
A gradual shift took place over time, from the late fifteenth century through the
middle of the seventeenth century, with U/u coming to phonetically signify a
vowel and V/v to signify a consonant, regardless of case or position in the word.
Likewise with i and j, although that shift was more irregular, with I/i coming to
phonetically signify a vowel and J/j a consonant. In the modern 26‐letter Latin
alphabet, i and j and u and v are all considered separate letters.
G4.2. Transcription. As instructed in rule 0G2.2, when the rules for capitalization
require converting I or V to lowercase, or i, j, u, or v to uppercase, follow the
pattern of usage in the text to determine which letterform to use in the
APPENDIX G. EARLY LETTERFORMS AND SYMBOLS
Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) 191
transcription.22 Establish the pattern of usage by examining text in the same
typeface (i.e., roman, italic, or gothic) in the publication being described. Look for
letters expressed in the opposite case from the letterforms to be converted, but
having the same function (vowel or consonant) and same relative position
(appearing in initial, medial, or final positions) as the letterforms to be converted.
Begin by examining the remainder of the title page and then, if necessary,
proceed to examine the body of the text in other parts of the book in the same
typeface. If the pattern of usage cannot be determined within a reasonable
amount of time, use this conversion table as a solution of last resort.
Uppercase letterform to be converted Lowercase conversion
I (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word23 i
II at end of word ij
II elsewhere in word ii
V (vowel or consonant) at beginning of word v
V (vowel or consonant) elsewhere in word u
VV representing single letter24 vv
Lowercase letterform to be converted Uppercase conversion
i (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word I
j (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word I
u (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word V
v (vowel or consonant) anywhere in word V
22 An uppercase J in the source usually signals that i and j are functioning as separate letters,
as are u and v, requiring no special consideration of I, J, i, or j while converting case in text with
that typeface. Likewise, an uppercase U in the source usually signals that u and v are functioning
as separate letters, requiring no special consideration of U, V, u, or v when converting case in text
in that typeface.
23 Do not convert a final uppercase I meant to represent an ii ending (see 0G2.3).
24 This must be distinguished from VV or vv as a combination of a vowel and a consonant as
in the examples VVLT or vvlt (vult, "he wants") and VVA or vva (uva, "grape").
APPENDIX G. EARLY LETTERFORMS AND SYMBOLS
192 Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
vv representing single letter25 VV
G5. Letter w
G5.1. Historical background. The representation of the letter w is not to be
confused with the developments of the u/v letterforms. The w letterform was
part of the standard alphabet for Germanic languages. Most early printing was in
Latin, shifting gradually to include a greater proportion of vernacular languages
throughout Europe. W and w must have been scanty in cases of roman type, and
they appear to have been frequently exhausted when setting text in Dutch,
English, or German. When that happened, compositors usually did one of two
things: used VV or vv to stand in for W or w, or permanently altered V or v type
pieces—achieved by filing or shaving one of the serifs, often the right serif on the
left piece—so that the two type pieces would sit closely together in the forme,
thereby more closely resembling a w. In early German texts, printers sometimes
used a curved r followed by a v to approximate a w.
G5.2. Transcription. When VV and vv letterforms have been used to represent
the single letter W or w, transcribe them as VV or vv as appropriate. When there
is clear evidence of the filing of one or both pieces of type showing the intention
of creating the W or w letterform, transcribe as W or w, making an explanatory
note, if considered important. In cases of doubt, transcribe as VV and vv. When
separate rv letterforms have been used by the printer to approximate the single
letter W or w, transcribe as W or w, making an explanatory note, if considered
important (see 0G7.2).

APPENDIX H. INDIVIDUAL AND SPECIAL ISSUES OF SERIALS
Apply these guidelines when creating a bibliographic record for an individual or
special issue of a serial, whether or not also creating a record for the serial as a
whole. Individual and special issues may be cataloged as monographs and
related to the serial as a whole.
H1. Bibliographic level
The bibliographic level for an issue of a serial is m (monograph), just as it is for
an individual part of a multipart monograph cataloged separately.
H2. Body of the description
H2.1. General rule
Formulate the body of the description according to the rules in DCRM(B).
Transcribe information in the form and order in which it is presented in the
source, unless instructed otherwise by specific rules (see 0G).
H2.2. Issues with distinctive titles
If the issue has a distinctive title, transcribe that title in the title and statement of
responsibility area.
H2.3. Issues without distinctive titles
H2.3.1. If the issue has no distinctive title, transcribe the title of the serial and the
numbering of the issue (including numeric and/or chronological designations) in
the title and statement of responsibility area.

APPENDIX H. INDIVIDUAL AND SPECIAL ISSUES OF SERIALS
Descriptive 194 Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)
H2.3.2. If the issue numbering appears at the head of title, transpose it and make
a note indicating the transposition (see 1B6).
H2.3.3. If the issue numbering appears following a statement of responsibility,
transcribe it as a subsequent statement of responsibility.
H3. Relating individual issues to the serial as a whole
H3.1. General rule
To relate the description of an individual issue to the description of the serial as a
whole and to provide organized access to the records in the catalog, make a
series added entry using the uniform title for the serial. Apply AACR2 and LCRI
in formulating the uniform title.
H3.2. Issues with distinctive titles
For access to the serial title on a monographic record for an issue that has a
distinctive title, give a simple series statement (440) if the serial title will be
traced in the form in which it appears on the piece. If the serial title appearing on
the piece is not in the form in which it will be traced, give an uncontrolled series
statement (490) with a series added entry (8XX).

H3.4. Issue numbering
H3.4.1. General rule. Transcribe issue numbering (including numeric and/or
chronological designations) in full in the descriptive areas, but standardize issue
numbering in the added entry for the serial. This will provide both the accurate
representation of individual issues as well as an organized display of sequential
issues within the catalog.

H4. Relating special issues to the serial as a whole
H4.1. Special issues
A special issue of a serial usually covers a particular topic. It may have a
distinctive title or it may simply be called "special issue" or the equivalent. Some
special issues are published within the numbering system of a serial; others are
published outside the numbering system of a serial. The statement identifying a
special issue as such may be presented formally in the publication or it may
presented informally (e.g., embedded in text).
H4.2. Special issues outside the numbering of a serial
If the special issue is outside the numbering of the serial, relate the monograph to
the serial title by giving a uniform title added entry (7XX) for the serial. If the

GLOSSARY
This glossary is intended to supplement the glossary in AACR2, Appendix D.
The terms included here are either lacking in AACR2, or, though present there,
require some amendment to accommodate these rules to the description of
special printed materials. The definitions marked with an asterisk have been
derived from G. Thomas Tanselle’s "The bibliographical concepts of issue and
state," in The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America, 69 (1975), p. 17‐66.
Bibliographic description. A set of bibliographic data recording and identifying
a publication, i.e., the description that begins with the title proper and ends
with the last note.
Broadside, broadsheet. See Single‐sheet publication.
Cancellation. A substitution for something originally printed. Usually applies to
leaves but may apply to portions of leaves, pairs of leaves, or entire
gatherings. The replacement leaf, etc., is called the cancel or cancellans (plural
cancels or cancellantia). The original leaf, etc., is variously called the cancelled
leaf, the uncancelled leaf (if it is still present), the cancelland, or the
cancellandum (plural cancellanda).
Chief title. The distinguishing word or sequence of words that names a
publication, as given on the title page (or substitute). This definition excludes
alternative titles, parallel titles, other title information, and subsidiary title
information preceding the chief title on the title page, such exclusion resulting
usually in a short title. See also Title proper.
Chronogram. A phrase, sentence, or other text in which the numeric values of
certain letters (usually distinguished typographically) express a date when
added together.
Device. A printed design, generally symbolic, emblematic, or pictorial rather
than textual, used to identify a printer, bookseller, or publisher. To be
distinguished from a logo that renders a name as a stylized, primarily textual
design.
Docket title. A title written, typed, or printed on a document, or on a label
affixed to the document, briefly indicating its contents or subject. Usually
GLOSSARY

found perpendicular to the main text, on an otherwise blank page (e.g., the
verso of the last leaf), on a document designed to be folded for filing.
*Edition. All copies resulting from a single job of typographical composition.
Fingerprint. A group of characters selected from specific locations in the
publication, which, when combined with the date of publication, etc., serves
to identify a book as having been printed from a certain setting of type.
Gathering. One or more pairs of leaves—made up of a folded sheet, a fraction of
a sheet, or several folded sheets tucked one inside another—that together
form a distinct unit for binding purposes. See also Signature.
Illustration. A pictorial, diagrammatic, or other graphic representation occurring
within a publication, excepting minor decorative elements such as vignettes,
head‐ and tail‐pieces, historiated initials, and printers’ ornaments.
Impression. All copies produced in the course of one printing event; the term is
synonymous with "printing."
Integral. 1. A leaf is integral to a gathering if it is conjugate with another leaf in
the gathering. 2. A leaf is integral to a publication if it can be assumed to be
present in all copies represented by the bibliographic description. Leaves
added after publication by an owner (e.g., extra‐illustrated copies) or by a
binder are not considered integral to the publication and thus must be
described in local notes.
*Issue. A group of published copies which constitutes a consciously planned
publishing unit, distinguishable from other groups of published copies by
one or more differences designed expressly to identify the group as a discrete
unit.
Leaf of plates. A plate in a publication that also has one or more leaves or pages
of text (whether preliminary text or text proper). Plates may be described in
terms of pages of plates if they are numbered as pages or are unnumbered
and have illustrative matter on both sides. See also Plate.
Letterpress. Printing done directly from raised surfaces. Includes printing done
from type, from wood blocks (e.g., woodcuts and wood‐engravings), and
from metal surfaces designed for relief printing (e.g., stereotypes and
electrotypes).
GLOSSARY
Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books) 201
Panel. A rectangular section formed by the creases in a single‐sheet publication
that has been issued folded but is intended to be used unfolded.
Perfect copy. A copy of a publication that is physically complete and correctly
arranged, as issued.
Plate. A leaf that is chiefly or entirely non‐letterpress, or a folded leaf of any
kind, inserted with letterpress gatherings of text. A plate usually contains
illustrative matter, with or without accompanying text, but may contain only
text (e.g., an engraved title page or a folded letterpress table). See also Leaf of
plates.
Signature. A letter, numeral, symbol, or a group of such characters, printed at
the foot of the rectos of the first few leaves of an intended gathering for the
purpose of aiding binders in correctly assembling the sections. See also
Gathering.
Single‐sheet publication. A publication printed on a single or composite piece of
paper or other material; it may be printed on one or both sides and may be
bound or unbound. The content of a single‐sheet publication, as here defined,
is predominantly textual in nature, though it may contain illustrations that
are subordinate or coordinate to the text. (See 5B2 for normally imposed
single sheets and 5B14 for single sheets designed to be read unfolded.)
*State. A copy or a group of copies of a printed sheet or a publisher’s casing
which differs from other copies (within the same impression or issue) of that
sheet or casing in any respect which the publisher does not wish to call to the
attention of the public as representing a discrete publishing effort.
Title proper. The chief title of a publication, together with any title information
preceding the chief title and any alternative title. This definition excludes
parallel titles and any other title information following the chief title. See also
Chief title.
Variant. A copy showing any bibliographically significant difference from one or
more other copies of the same edition. The term may refer to an impression,
issue, or state.
