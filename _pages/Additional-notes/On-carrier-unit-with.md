## 9.34.1 Element information

<a name="9.34.1.1">9.34.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content?externalId=en-US_ala-f9305084-ad80-3d9e-8c28-e649bb4f5500){:target="_blank"}

<a name="9.34.1.2">9.34.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/additional-notes/#9011-sources-of-information)

## 9.34.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="9.34.2.1">9.34.2.1</a> A manifestation that is a part of the same carrier unit as another part manifestation.

## 9.34.21 DCRMR elaboration of scope

<a name="9.34.21.1">9.34.21.1</a> Record an "issued with" relationship for a manifestation in which a volume is made up of two or more separately titled parts that are also separately paginated or foliated and have separate signatures, but which have been issued together by the publisher, distributor, etc. (See also [RDA Toolkit: Part work](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-6bc578be-fa3d-3499-a37a-f690b085d23e){:target="_blank"}.) Do not record an "issued with" relationship if the pagination, foliation, or signatures of separately titled parts are continuous with the part being described. Instead, record these as a contents note (see [Note on manifestation, 9.3.32.1](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Note-on-manifestation/#9.3.32.1)).

## 9.34.25 Related element

<a name="9.34.25.1">9.34.25.1</a> See [Bound with](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Bound-with/) for manifestations bound together subsequent to publication, rather than issued together by the publisher, distributor, etc.

## 9.34.3 General rule

<a name="9.34.3.1">9.34.3.1</a>  Record this relationship as a structured note beginning with “Issued with” followed by a colon. List the related manifestations, in the order in which they are found. In the case of bound volumes, list all related manifestations in the description for the first manifestation and, in general, only the first manifestations in the descriptions for the subsequent manifestations. 

<a name="9.34.3.2">9.34.3.2</a> For each manifestation listed, give only the elements listed below:

a) The RDA Creator agent of work (see [RDA Toolkit: Creator agent of work](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-6277a869-961d-379f-8ae8-7ec159052a26){:target="_blank"}); normally give this element first, usually in access point form (e.g., with inversion of personal names under surname, but not necessarily including personal birth/death dates, corporate qualifiers, etc.)  

b) The [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as found in the description for the manifestation; long titles may be shortened by omitting words after the first five (or, if the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) begins with an article, the first six words). Use the mark of omission. If the preferred title of work is considered useful for the identification of the work, record it within square brackets preceding the title of manifestation  

c) The primary [Statement of responsibility relating to title proper](/DCRMR/sor/Statement-of-responsibility-relating-to-title-proper/) as recorded in the description for the manifestation, unless it is already recorded as the RDA Creator agent of work or is exceedingly lengthy (see [RDA Toolkit:  Creator agent of work](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-6277a869-961d-379f-8ae8-7ec159052a26){:target="_blank"})

d) The [Publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Publication-statement/) as found in the description for the manifestation, abridged as necessary, without using the mark of omission

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Issued with: Dunton, John. The merciful assizes, or, A panegyric on the late Lord Jeffreys hanging so many in the West. London : Printed for Eliz. Harris, 1701</CITE>

<a name="9.34.3.3">9.34.3.3</a> *Optionally*, record an RDA Access point for manifestation for the related manifestation(s) in addition to the note (see [RDA Toolkit: Access point for manifestation](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-b110f24e-6bb0-3144-84c5-da69b4016504){:target="_blank"}).
