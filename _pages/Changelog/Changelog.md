## Current release

### DCRMR 202x.1.0.0  
Release date: 202x-x-x-x  
Release PDF: 

Usually, this would be a summary from the chief editors for a high-level release. Said summary will give a general overview and feel of what's happened in the release. The keepers then add in the rest of the categories as necessary. 

However, this branch is for keepers to experiment in, so there are no high level release notes. 

The starting point of this fork is the current DCRMR main branch. It was forked in May 2024. 

Hello, world. 

My thought in creating this branch, keeperdemo, on a fork from the main DCRMR respository is that we could use it as a place to play and experiment with how to update the repository (i.e., all of the files that make the DCRMR website exist and that contain the text of DCRMR). I copied the google doc files from the initial graphics ingest, and we can use them to do edits. The files are in a subfolder in the shared DCRMR google drive, [Editors/Keepers admin docs / keeper intro files 2024](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DDvGg_-tpP5kKJpUC1ekTUsPeQbzYgRh){:target="_blank"}.

### DCRMR 2022.2.0.0   
Release date: 2022-11-15  
Release PDF: [DCRMR RDA edition release 2022.2.0.0 PDF](https://rbms-bsc.github.io/DCRMR/assets/pdfs/DCRM%20RDA%20edition%20release%202022_2_0_0.pdf)  

DCRMR 2022.2.0.0 adds a glossary based, in large part, on the glossaries in previous DCRM manuals, although some definitions have been updated to align with RDA terminology. The glossary covers terms applicable to all rare materials formats and those limited to books; other format-specific terms will be incorporated in future releases.

To remain aligned with changes made in the [March 23, 2022 release of the RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Resource/Index?externalId=en-US_topic_03232022_RN), two elements have been renamed and their definitions changed. Manifestation described in is now [Manifestation described by](/DCRMR/additional-notes/Manifestation-described-by/); Issued with is now [On carrier unit with](/DCRMR/additional-notes/On-carrier-unit-with/). These changes do not affect cataloging outcomes.

This release adds general rules to all elements that previously lacked them, updates the presentation of Editorial Group membership, and introduces a formal changelog versioning system. It also changes the formatting and font of the examples within the text for improved visual clarity.
