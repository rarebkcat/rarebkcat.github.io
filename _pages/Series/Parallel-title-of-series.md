## 8.215.1 Element information

<a name="8.215.1.1">8.215.1.1</a> [Link to RDA Toolkit](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Content/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-9a2bd933-3204-3798-840a-dc55a5a237d0){:target="_blank"}

<a name="8.215.1.2">8.215.1.2</a> [Sources of information](/DCRMR/series/#8011-sources-of-information)

## 8.215.2 RDA definition and scope

<a name="8.215.2.1">8.215.2.1</a> A nomen that is a title of series in another language or script.

## 8.215.3 General rule

<a name="8.215.3.1">8.215.3.1</a> If the source bears a series title in more than one language or script, transcribe as [Title of series](/DCRMR/series/Title-of-series/) the title that is in the language and script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/). If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the title that appears first in the source. Transcribe the remaining title(s), together with any associated information, as Parallel title of series. Always make a [Note on series statement](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/) to indicate the original position on the source of any transposed titles (see [8.29.3.2.Y.Y](/DCRMR/series/Note-on-series-statement/#8.29.3.2.Y.Y)).

>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>Canadian cities, bird’s eye views</CITE>  
>Parallel title of series: <CITE>Villes du Canada, vues à vol d’oiseau</CITE>

>**Example:**  
>Title of series: <CITE>Europäische Hochschulschriften</CITE>  
>Parallel title of series: <CITE>European university papers</CITE>  
>Parallel title of series: <CITE>Publications universitaires européennes</CITE>

<a name="8.215.3.2">8.215.3.2</a> *Optionally*, if the parallel titles of series in a single statement are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of parallel titles of series in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.

## 8.215.31 Parallel subseries titles

<a name="8.215.31.1">8.215.31.1</a> If there are both parallel titles of series and subseries titles on the resource, transcribe each subseries after the series title to which it relates. If any parallel titles have been omitted from the transcription, also omit their associated subseries.
