## 5.35.3.Y.Y General rule 

<a name="5.35.3.1.Y.Y">5.35.3.1.Y.Y</a> Transcribe a copyright date or a date of deposit as Copyright date. Follow the instructions in [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/) for the transcription of such dates.

<a name="5.35.3.2.Y.Y">5.35.3.2.Y.Y</a> If a [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/) does not appear on the manifestation and it is likely that the date of copyright or deposit represents the [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/), supply the date in square brackets as the [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/) (see [5.23.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/#5.23.33.1)). Always indicate the copyright date as the basis for the conjecture in a [Note on publication statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/) (see [5.24.36.7](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-publication-statement/#5.24.36.7)).

>**Example:**  
>Date of publication: <CITE>[1866]</CITE>  
>Note on publication statement: <CITE>Date of publication based on copyright date. Copyright statement on title page verso reads: Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1866, by J.R. Jones, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, in and for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania</CITE>  

<a name="5.35.3.3.Y.Y">5.35.3.3.Y.Y</a> If a [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/) does not appear on the manifestation, and the date of copyright or deposit does not represent the probable date of publication, record it nonetheless in Copyright date, and supply a more accurate date of publication in square brackets (see [5.23.33.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/#5.23.33.1)). Provide an explanation for the supplied date in a [Note on copyright date](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/) (see [5.36.3.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-copyright-date/#5.36.3.1)).

<a name="5.35.3.4.Y.Y">5.35.3.4.Y.Y</a> If the manifestation bears both a [Date of publication](/DCRMR/ppdm/Date-of-publication/) and a date of copyright or deposit, the latter information may be recorded in Copyright date if considered important.
