<a name="5.31.3.3">5.31.3.3</a> In general, transcribe the full address. Consider the sequence, layout, and typography of words in the manufacture statement when determining the most appropriate element in which to transcribe the address. If address information is grammatically inseparable from the manufacturer’s name, transcribe the information as part of the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) (see [5.32.3.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/#5.32.3.1)).

<a name="5.31.3.4">5.31.3.4</a> *Optionally*, omit, using the mark of omission, addresses and insignificant information appearing in the middle or end of the Place of manufacture, unless information is grammatically inseparable, aids in identifying or dating the manifestation, or is considered important to the cataloging agency (e.g., for the purpose of capturing book trade data).

## 5.31.31 Place of manufacture with initial prepositions, etc.

<a name="5.31.31.1">5.31.31.1</a> Transcribe any prepositions appearing before the place of manufacture as well as any accompanying words or phrases associated with the place name.

## 5.31.323 Supplied fuller forms of place names 

<a name="5.31.323.1">5.31.323.1</a>  If a place name is found only in an abbreviated form on the manifestation, transcribe it as found. Supply in square brackets the full form of the name, or the remainder of the name, if considered important.

## 5.31.325 Supplied larger jurisdictions

<a name="5.31.325.1">5.31.325.1</a> Supply in square brackets the name of the country, state, province, etc., after the name of the place if it is considered necessary for identification, or if it is considered necessary to distinguish the place from others of the same name. Use a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency. 

<a name="5.31.325.2">5.31.325.2</a> *Optionally*, use the abbreviations for names in English listed in [RDA Toolkit: Abbreviations of terms in English for countries and states](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/Resource/Index?externalId=en-US_ala-d2830026-0cec-3123-ab3c-9214bdada254){:target="_blank"}.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>Printed at the Theater in Oxford, and in London</CITE>  

<a name="5.31.33.2">5.31.33.2</a> *Optionally*, if the places are considered too numerous to list exhaustively and some may be omitted without significant loss of identification, all after the third may be omitted. Supply in square brackets a phrase in the language and script of the cataloging agency to convey the nature of the omitted information. Include the number of omitted places in the supplied phrase. Do not use the mark of omission.

<a name="5.31.33.3">5.31.33.3</a> If a subsequent place of manufacture is not related to the same manufacturer, transcribe it in association with the manufacture to which it corresponds.

<a name="5.31.33.4">5.31.33.4</a> Do not, however, transcribe a subsequent place as a Place of manufacture if it must be recorded as a grammatically inseparable part of another element.

<a name="5.31.33.5">5.31.33.5</a> If a place of manufacture associated with an earlier manifestation appears together with the actual place of manufacture of the manifestation being described, transcribe the places as a single element in the order in which they appear.

<a name="5.31.33.6">5.31.33.6</a> If both the place and [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) associated with an earlier manifestation appear together with the place and [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) of the manifestation being described, transcribe each place with the manufacturer to which it corresponds.

(Transcribe a statement containing the address or sign in as the [Name of manufacturer](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/) element; see [5.32.36.1](/DCRMR/ppdm/Name-of-manufacturer/#5.32.36.1).) When supplying the place of manufacture, give a justification in a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) if not apparent from the rest of the description and if considered important (see [5.34.32.5](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.5)). If the supplied place name is uncertain, record it following the instructions at [5.31.385](/DCRMR/ppdm/Place-of-manufacture/#531385-place-of-manufacture-uncertain-or-unknown).

## 5.31.385 Place of manufacture uncertain or unknown

<a name="5.31.385.1">5.31.385.1</a> If the place of manufacture is uncertain, and it is considered important, supply the name of the probable place of manufacture with a question mark, using a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency in square brackets.

>**Example:**  
><CITE>[Newburyport, Mass.?]</CITE>  

<a name="5.31.385.2">5.31.385.2</a> If no city of manufacture can be conjectured, and it is considered important, supply the name of a state, province, country, or other larger geographic entity as the place of manufacture with a question mark if necessary, using a modern form of the name in the language of the cataloging agency in square brackets.

<a name="5.31.385.3">5.31.385.3</a> If the basis of the supplied place is not apparent from the rest of the description, always make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/) to indicate the source of the information (see [5.34.32.4](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.4)). 

>**Example:**  
>Place of manufacture: <CITE>[Québec?]</CITE>

<a name="5.31.385.4">5.31.385.4</a> If no place of manufacture can be conjectured, record “Place of manufacture not identified” in square brackets.

## 5.31.39 Place names in more than one language or script

<a name="5.31.39.1">5.31.39.1</a> If the place of manufacture appears in more than one language or script, transcribe the place in the language or script of the [Title proper](/DCRMR/title/Title-proper/) as Place of manufacture. If this criterion does not apply, transcribe the place that appears first as Place of manufacture. Transcribe remaining place(s) as [Parallel place of manufacture](/DCRMR/ppdm/Parallel-place-of-manufacture/). For transposed elements, always make a [Note on manufacture statement](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement) to indicate the original position on the source (see [5.34.32.6](/DCRMR/ppdm/Note-on-manufacture-statement/#5.34.32.6)).

>**Example:**  
>Place of manufacture: <CITE>Birminghamiae</CITE>  
>Parallel place of manufacture: <CITE>Printed at Birmingham</CITE>
